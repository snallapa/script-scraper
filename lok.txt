Kyoshi bends earth and punches it to the left. The camera cuts to the tight. Roku strikes left and right, fire bursting from his hands. We cut back to the left to find an adult Aang, his jaw trimmed with a dark beard. He dances and kicks at stage center. We cut upwards. Korra sloppily waterbenders, soaking the camera. The screen whites out.</i><br><br><i>When it dims, an aged ink drawing fills the screen. It's Team Avatar from the original series, at the age we last saw them. From left to right: Sokka brandishes his space swords, Suki is dressed in her Kyoshi Warrior uniform, Toph is earthbending, Katara is waterbending, Zuko is firebending, and Aang is airbending. The camera pans rightward across the drawing before finally focusing on Aang. His eyes and arrow tattoos begin to glow white. Then they flash.</i><br><br><i>A standard Avatar world map appears. The camera zooms in, tilting and turning, and the map becomes partly three dimensional with regards to the mountains and volcanos. The camera approaches a spot in the Earth Kingdom's continental northwest. The screen whites out again, as if the camera is passing through clouds. When it comes through the other side, the view is one of a flyover shot of Republic City. The camera can see the whole width of the sprawling city. Then the camera shoots into the waters of Yue Bay, before coming up for a shot of the city's skyline. The camera races towards the skyline, only to veer off to the left, turning around to approach Aang's giant memorial statue. The camera keeps moving, but slows for a moment to linger on Aang's face. It shoots up vertically into a cloud-filed sky,  finally settling on a shot of the blazing sun.]</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(voice over)</i> Earth... Fire... Air... Water.<br><br>When I was a boy, my father, Avatar Aang, told me the story of how he and his friends heroically ended the Hundred Year War.<br><br>Avatar Aang and Firelord Zuko transformed the Fire Nation colonies into the United Republic of Nations, a society where benders and non-benders from all over the world could live and thrive together in peace and harmony. They named the capital of this great land "Republic City".<br><br>Avatar Aang accomplished many remarkable things in his life, but sadly his time in this world came to an end. And like the cycle of the seasons, the cycle of the Avatar began anew.<br><br><br><br><u><b>Act I</b></u><br><br><i>(It's nighttime in the Southern Water Tribe, the sky filled with storm clouds and the air with snow. The camera pans down to reveal mountains along a coastline. In the background, a coastal city blazes with bright lights. Yet our interest is the three cloaked figure advancing up the hillside, the central figure holding aloft a lantern.</i><br><br><i>We cut to a view behind the trio as they reach the crest of their hilltop. Their purple cloaks stand out against the white snow. The trio pauses. Their new focus is shared by the camera; the hazy background sharpens. There are a few homes atop the hill.</i><br><br><i>We cut to a view of this landscape, with several igloos and tents dotting it, and the camera pans across it. Three tiny figures approach one igloo; it blazes with light.</i><br><br><i>We cut to the wooden door of that dwelling. Tonraq, a large muscular man in Water Tribe clothing, is holding aloft a lantern. He bows his head in respect to the cloaked figure in the foreground.)</i><br><br><b>Tonraq:</b> The White Lotus has honored my family by coming. Thank you.<br><br><i>(Tonraq turns and pushing open the door. Senna, his wife, is sweeping in the center of their home. Her robe is stained and their house is clearly in a state of disrepair. Senna halts her sweeping and bows.)</i><br><br><b>Senna:</b> Welcome.<br><br><i>(Her statement is puncuated by a decorative shield falling off the wall.</i><br><br><i>The cloaked figures pull of their hoods. Tonraq walks around them. Their leader, a short, hefty man with greying hair, speaks.)</i><br><br><b>White Lotus Leader:</b> We have investigated many claims, both here and in the Northern Tribe. All have turned out to be false.<br><br><i>(Tonraq comes over to Senna and puts an arm on her shoulder. The couple smiles at one another, then turns back to the trio.)</i><br><br><b>Senna:</b> Then you should be happy to know, your search has come to an end. <br><br><i>(Cut to a close-up view of the trio. They are clearly unimpressed with this declaration.)</i><br><br><b>White Lotus Leader:</b> What makes you so sure your daughter is the "one"?<br><br><i>(Cut back on the couple. Senna turns to the left and calls out.)</i><br><br><b>Senna:</b> Korra, please come in here.<br><br><i>(Cut back to the White Lotus trio. They're facing the camera, still looking bland, when a slab of rock flies past them. Their eyes shoot wide. They turn, startled, to the right. The camera zooms rightward, revealing a circular hole in the room's stone interior wall. Backlit by a bright light, a kid Korra strikes an action pose and then starts jumping around, bending the various elements.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> I'm the Avatar, you gotta deal with it!<br><br><i>(We cut to Korra encroaching on the trio. They step back, their expressions still shocked, as Korra bends. A shot of the trio's leader getting the hem of his cloak set ablaze is followed by Korra putting out the small fire with a spot of bent water. We pan up from their feet to find the trio is still surprised. They look from the extinguished cloak fire to Korra, and the camera cuts to Korra still moving through the elements.</i><br><br><i>Finally, this young Korra blasts fire straight on into the camera, filling the screen, and when the red flames die away many years have passed. The Korra we see now is seventeen years old. She is dressed in red-toned protective gear atop her usual Water Tribe flavor clothes. In the background is her training grounds, set amid the snowy mountains of the South Pole. But all this passes in a blur, for Korra is in combat. She kicks flames at the camera and we cut to one of her training partners, also dressed in red, failing to block her attack. He's knocked off his feet and thrown backwards.</i><br><br><i>We cut to a new shot as that man rolls away under the camera. There are two more red-garbbed sparring partners, and past them, watching this battle unfold, are a handful of figures. Korra jumps into shot, turning to face her two remaining opponents. They simultaneously blast fireballs at her.</i><br><br><i>We cut to a shot overlooking the battle, with the camera hanging just behind the onlookers. We see now that of the five, three of them are the same trio of White Lotus officials from Korra's childhood, if with more white in their hair. </i><br><br><i>We cut to face Korra again, where, boasting a cocky expression, she easily disperse the double attack.</i><br><br><i>We cut to a side view of her two sparring partners. The one closest to the camera punches forward, blasting more fire, and then he moves leftward off-screen towards Korra. A cut back to Korra shows her dodging the incoming fireballs and advancing on her opponents. The next shot shows her two enemies continuing their attacks, with one man charging Korra and the other running to circle around. The first man attempts a mid-air spinning kick, but Korra rolls under the attack and unbalances the man with a kick to his foot. Off-balance, the man tumbles wildly through the air. He hits the ground hard but recovers. </i><br><br><i>Korra now finds herself between the two firebenders. </i><br><br><i>As the second man blasts her with fire, the first man charges her. Korra deals with both attacks simultaneously; dispelling the fire with her hands and kicking backwards at the first man. She immediately launches into the offensive, firing blasts at the second man.</i><br><br><i>We cut to a sideways shot of him taking the brunt of Korra's attack. It's too much. He grunts as he's overwhelmed and thrown backwards off his feet.</i><br><br><i>We cut to a shot of Korra's back as the first man charges on screen. He blasts her with fireball punches, but Korra's guard is too good. Nothing gets through her defense. A sideways shot of Korra shows her blocking fireballs from both sides of the screen. An especially large one overwhelms the camera, and when the flames die out we get a close-up shot of a determined Korra. She uses both arms and unleashes a ferocious attack at the camera, and we cut to a sideways shot of her and the second man to see its effect. Her target is rocketed off his feet and into the air. Smoking, he arcs over and hits the roof of the building the observers are standing in. Limp and groaning, he slides down the wooden roof and becomes tangled up in the railing at its edge. Directly below him, the five observes are staring up.</i><br><br><i>We cut to a sidewards view of the five, panning right-to-left. An elderly woman near the camera, her white hair styled in distinctive loopies, is impressed.)</i><br><br><b>Katara:</b> She's strong.<br><br><i>(As the other two Lotus members and an elderly Fire Nation return their focus to the battlefield, the leader of the trio turns his head to look at Katara. His expression is one of severe disapproval, even annoyance.)</i><br><br><b>White Lotus Leader:</b> She lacks restraint.<br><br><i>(We cut back to the training grounds, with a sideways shot of the remaining duelist. He runs towards the right, continuously blasting fire with both hands. We cut back to Korra, smiling with wolfish enjoyment, as she runs to the left. The camera pulls in close on her face and the incoming flame adds an orange-ish tone to her skin. Her grin never falters. Cutting to an overhead view of the two, we see now that Korra is running head-on into a gigantic sustained fire plume. Cutting into the middle of the churning inferno, Korra presses her way into view, forcing aside the flames and moving towards the camera. Her expression is no longer wolfish. Instead, it is one of fixed, grim determination. </i><br><br><i>The camera cuts to the remaining duelist standing in the middle of the screen. Korra, having forced her way through his flames, seems about to grab hold of both his wrists. Instead, as the man freaks out at this sudden reversal, she takes advantage of his surprise to leap atop him, summersaulting off his left shoulder. We cut to a view of Korra spin through the air, the camera looking down as she is on the distraught man below, and hang with this for a few moments. Then we cut to a forward view of Korra hanging in the air; she unleashes a kick that spews flames at the man below, who throws his arms up to shelter himself. A close-up cut to Korra, expression still one of grim focus, flows into her unleashing jets of flames with both arms. As she gracefully lands, we cut to a shot of the smoldering duelist with the five onlookers in the background. The duelist collapses. </i><br><br><i>We cut back to Korra facing the camera. She throws both arms into the air and goes woo-hoo. A reaction shot of the adult onlookers shows that only Katara is pleased. The trio's leader, arms folded across his chest, is clearly peeved. The two other White Lotus members aren't impressed either, with the spectacled man raising an eyebrow. The finely dressed Fire Nation man, hands held behind his back, possesses a neutral expression. </i><br><br><i>We cut to an overhead shot of the five onlookers as Korra runs towards them and stops at the edge of the training field.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Woo hoo! Hey, why all the doom and gloom people? We should be celebrating! Three elements down, one to go. <br><br><i>(Cut to Korra facing the camera. Off to her left in the background, one of her sparring partners sits on the ground rubbing his head. Korra pulls off her safety helmet. She's ecstatic.</i><br><br><i>Cut to a close sideways view of Katara, the Fire Nation man, and the trio's leader. The camera moves pass Katara, focusing on both the Fire Nation man and the trio's leader as they speak.)</i><br><br><b>Firebending Master:</b> You're getting ahead of yourself as usual Korra. We haven't decided if you passed your firebending test yet.<br><b>White Lotus Leader:</b> Ever since you were a little girl, you've excelled at the physical side of bending, but completely ignored the spiritual side. The Avatar must master both.<br><br><i>(Cut back to Korra reacting. Her lips are pursed and her eyelids half-drawn. She's even less impressed then they were a moment ago. Shoulders slumping forward, she looks abashed for a moment, yet her cheerful attitude soon reasserts itself.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> I haven't ignored it. It just doesn't come as easy to me. But that's why I should start training with Tenzin immediately. He's "Mister Spiritual."<br><br><i>(Cut back to overhead shot of the assembly. The trio's leader bodily turns toward Katara.)</i><br><br><b>White Lotus Leader:</b> Do you believe she's ready Master Katara?<br><br><i>(Cut to close-up of the five elders.)</i><br><br><b>Katara:</b> Yes. If anyone can teach her what she needs to learn, its Tenzin.<br><br><i>(Katara's answer provokes quiet shock and dismay from the group. Korra's firebending instructor's jaw drops. The two White Loti in the back row close their eyes and slightly bow their heads. Soon, the other two elders join them in bowing their heads to Master Katara's decision. Then they all open their eyes and raise their heads.)</i><br><br><b>White Lotus Leader:</b> Very well, Korra. It's time for you to begin your airbending training.<br><br><i>(Cut to Korra. She jumps for joy, then remembers she still has an audience. A reaction shot shows only Katara is remotely approving of the Avatar's behavior. Cutting back to Korra, she clears her throat and solemnly thanks them.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Yes! Finally! I mean... Thank you all for believing in me. <br><br><i>(Cut to Korra walking away from the group of elders. She can barely contain her excitement and quickly turns and runs off. We get a quick close-up of a smiling Katara.</i><br><br><i>A new scene, looking up a stone staircase. Korra practically flies down it and pushes through the gate at the bottom.  Cut to a large polar bear-dog sleeping curled up on its side, its back to the camera. The ground is covered in hay. A modest "dog house" igloo occupies the background. Naga, her tail wagging, stands and walks towards the camera. Cut to Korra hugging Naga and scratching her head. Naga licks her smiling, laughing mistress.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Naga, you should have seen it. I kicked some firebender butt, and I passed! Tenzin will be here in a few days.<br><br><i>(Cut to overhead shot of the training complex. Aside from the training grounds at its center, there are several industrial-looking bits along the walls. The front gate features grand double-doors decorated in a lion-turtle's head. The camera zooms in a tiny figure in the mid-ground. It's Korra atop Naga.</i><br><br><i>Cut to one of the towers beside the front gate. An Order of the White Lotus guard walks up to the edge of his tower. Cut down to Korra, standing in the shadow of the compound's walls, staring up at the guard. Cut back to the guard, who's clearly not keen on Korra's request. Cut back to Korra, now with crossed arms and a tired-looking expression.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Just taking Naga out for a stroll. Don't worry we're not going far.<br><br><i>(Cut back to the guard. Still not looking entirely convinced, he turns around. Cut to a wide shot of Korra before the gate as it opens. Cut to a close-up on Korra's face as the door peels open, the daylight illuminating her eager expression in the shadows. Cut to a backshot of Korra taking Naga through the still-opening gates. The camera follows her through them, out onto a vast polar landscape of icy plains. </i><br><br><i>Cut to a distant shot. In the background, now nothing more than a mere dot on the snowscape, bound Korra and Naga. The compound is little more the even more distant smudge. Yet in the foreground, atop a rocky hillside overlooking the plains below, are two White Lotus members, monitoring the Avatar below...</i><br><br><i>Cut to a sideways shot of Korra, her mount's reins in her hands. The camera pulls back as Naga picks up speed.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Naga go. That a girl. Go! Go! Go!<br><br><i>(Cut to a front-on shot of Korra riding Naga. She looks determined and content.</i><br><br><i>New scene. Another distant overhead shot of the Avatar's training pound, this time in the golden light of the evening. A sky-bison swoops onscreen from behind the camera, jostling it as it passes. The beast flies down toward the compound. Cut to a ground-level shot of Korra and Katara's backs as they stare up into the sky as the sky-bison comes in for a landing. The camera pans up, following their gaze, until it stops as the sky-bison passes overhead. Korra runs onscreen, smiling, and heads toward the sky-bison.</i><br><br><i>Cut to a shot of the sky-bison circling around the compound's main building, finally coming in for a landing. We can see several orange shapes atop the beast, as well as Korra and Master Katara waiting on the ground.)</i><br><br><b>Ikki:</b> Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet? It looks like we are there. I know this is very familiar. Are we here yet? Are we here yet? Oh, please say we are here!<br><br><i>(Cut to a front-on shot of the sky-bison, where we see Tenzin's family for the first time. Meelo is gnawing on his father's head. Jinora and Ikki are perches at the edge of the saddle behind their father. To the back right, Pema sits. Tenzin himself, holding the reins, seems exhausted.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Yes, Ikki. As I have been telling you for the last 15 minutes, we are finally here. <br><br><i>(Ikki and Jinora leap out of the saddle, riding air scooters down their sky-bison's tail. Tenzin, with Meelo still clinging to his head, merely walks off the bison.)</i><br><br><b>Ikki:</b> Weee! Hehehe!<br><br><i>(Cut to Tenzin and Katara approaching one another. He raises one hand in a formal greeting as his girls cling to his sides and Meelo pulls at his ears. When he leans forward, a chuckling Katara takes Meelo off him.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Hello, Mother. I can't tell you happy I am to see you. Please, help me.<br><br><i>(Cut to Katara holding Meelo. He squirms and struggles.)</i><br><br><b>Meelo:</b> Unhand me strange woman!<br><br><i>(Cut to Tenzin.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> That's your grandmother, Meelo.<br><br><i>(Meelo hops over his grandmother's head and floats to the ground. Now with a serious expression, he runs off-screen. Katara is wide-eyed for a moment, but then her happy expression reasserts itself.)</i><br><br><b>Katara:</b> It's so good to see all of you.<br><br><i>(Cut to a shot of Jinora standing before Katara. The young girl is clutching her hands together and stooping slightly. She looks eager.)</i><br><br><b>Jinora:</b> Gran Gran, I have been reading all about your old adventures. I've been dying to ask you, what happened to Zuko's mom?<br><br><i>(Cut back to Katara, who begins to speak before Ikki jumps up in front of her, waving her arms.)</i><br><br><b>Katara:</b> Well, Jinora, it's an incredible tale...<br><br><i>(Cut to Ikki and Jinora. Ikki is jumping up and down. Jinora's expression cycles from annoyance at the interruption to resignation. Cut to a shot of Katara as Ikki's head bobs up and down in the foreground. Cut to a shot of the entire Tenzin clan. Ikki is still hopping and clapping her hands. Jinora slumps her head, despondent. In the background, a very pregnant Pema is struggling to slide down the sky-bison's tail. Tenzin goes over and helps her.)</i><br><br><b>Ikki:</b> Gran Gran, you look old. How old are you? And why is it so cold in the South Pole? Can we make a campfire and all hudle around it and tell scary stories, and make snowmen? And then can you make the snowmen move with waterbending and chase us? Wouldn't that be fun? Huh, wouldn't it?<br><b>Tenzin:</b> Pema let me help you. Careful now. Careful.<br><b>Pema:</b> Stop doting on me. I'm not helpless, I'm just pregnant.<br><br><i>(Cut to a sideways shot of Tenzin, his wife, and his mother. Pema and Katara hug, then the latter puts a hand on the former's belly.)</i><br><br><b>Katara:</b> The baby's strong. I see another airbender in your future.<br><br><i>(A shot of Katara's hand on Pema's belly. We pan up to Pema's face. Katara's pronouncement causes Pema's expression to change from a pleasant one, to a surprised one, to finally a dismayed one. When Pema begins to voice her own desires, both Katara and Tenzin look surprised at what she says. While Tenzin continues to look rather 'blah' over Pema's words and begins to fiddle with his goatee, Katara just smiles. When Meelo calls from off-screen, an annoyed Pema looks toward the camera.)</i><br><br><b>Pema:</b> All I want is just one child like me. A nice non bender who doesn't blast wind in my face every 5 seconds.<br><br><i>(Cut to the three children playing in snow. Jinora ice skates off-screen, stage left, using her airbending. Ikki is making a snowman. Meelo, covered entirely in snow, whirls around with his airbending, blasting Pema with snow. Cut back to Pema, who shakes off the snow, looking annoyed and with a few more stray hairs. Cutting to a view of all three adults, an exhausted Pema points to Tenzin.)</i><br><br><b>Meelo:</b> Mommy look, I'm a snow bender!<br><b>Pema:</b> Were Tenzin and his siblings this crazy when they were kids?<br><br><i>(Cut to a close-up of Katara.)</i><br><br><b>Katara:</b> Kya and Bumi certainly were, but Tenzin has always been rather serious.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> Mother, please. <br><br><i>(Cut to a close-up of a rather serious looking Tenzin. When he looks past Katara, the camera cuts to a shot of a smiling Korra behind Katara's left shoulder. Cutting back to Tenzin, we see him lightly surprised. With the sunset backing them all, Korra walks over to Tenzin and he puts his hands on her shoulders.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Korra? Look at you. So big and strong. You've grown into quite the young Avatar.<br><b>Korra:</b> Master Tenzin, I'm so glad you're here. I can't wait to get started.<br><br><i>(Cut to a close-up of Tenzin. He turns his head to the side, not able to meet Korra's eyes.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Yes, well... uh...<br><br><i>(Cut to a shot of all four. Pema turns to Tenzin to talk, leaving Korra looking confused.)</i><br><br><b>Pema:</b> You're going to have to tell her sooner or later.<br><b>Korra:</b> What? Tell me what?<br><br><i>(Cut to a close-up of Katara, zooming in. She looks disappointed.)</i><br><br><b>Katara:</b> You're not staying are you?<br><br><i>(Tenzin, a hand still on Korra's shoulder, explains. Korra's reaction is one of confusion; this isn't how things are supposed to work.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> I'm afraid not. We're only visiting for the night, then I have to return to Republic City.<br><b>Korra:</b> But, no... you're supposed to move here. You're supposed to teach me. <br><br><i>(Tenzin puts both hands on Korra's shoulders.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> I'm sorry Korra, your airbending training is going to have to wait.<br><br><i>(Fade to black for commercial break.)</i><br><br><br><br><u><b>Act II</b></u><br><br><i>(We return with a nighttime overhead shot of the training compound. Several structures are illuminated by electric lights. Cut to the inside of some building. It's a dining hall decorated in the Water Tribe fashion. At the center of each table is an open pit spit roast, but there is no meat on any of them tonight, presumably in respect of Tenzin's vegetarianism. Korra, Tenzin, and the three White Lotus masters sit at the room's far table. The rest of the place is deserted.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> So how long until you are ready to teach me airbending? A week? A month? <br><br><i>(Cut to a close-up of Tenzin. Korra, sitting with a bowl of rice before her and some sort of stew off to the side, still looks dismayed. The camera cuts back and forth in their conversation.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> It could be much longer<br><b>Korra:</b> I don't understand. Why are you making me wait?<br><b>Tenzin:</b> I have a responsibility to Republic City. I am one of it's leaders, and the situation there is very unstable right now.<br><b>Korra:</b> But you also have a responsibility to teach me. Believe me I'd be happy to find another airbending master, but you're the only one. We're stuck with each other.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> I wish there were another way.<br><br><i>(Korra perks up.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Wait, there is! If you can't stay here, then i'll go back to Republic City with you. It's perfect!<br><br><i>(Cut to a shot of the Loti trio's leader, sitting across from Korra. He slaps the table, jostling his dinner.)</i><br><br><b>White Lotus Leader:</b> Absolutely not! The city is far too dangerous. Avatar Aang tasked us with keeping you safe while you mastered the four elements.<br><br><i>(Cut back to Korra, leaning on the table, from an over-the-shoulder shot of the Lotus leader.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> I get that. But I don't think keeping me locked up in this compound like a prisoner is what he had in mind.<br><br><i>(Cut to a shot of all three characters, with Tenzin in the center. When the airbender finishes speaking, Korra stands up.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> I know this is difficult to accept, but its not the right time for you to come to the city.<br><b>Korra:</b> Whatever.<br><br><i>(Cut to Tenzin and the trio's leader watching Korra's back as she walks out the nearest door. Cut back to a reaction shot of the two men. The White Lotus leader sighs. Tenzin, eyes closed, bows his head.</i><br><br><i>Cut to an outdoor shot the next morning. Katara, with her back to the camera in the foreground, waves to her family atop their sky-bison.)</i><br><br><b>Ikki:</b> Goodbye, Gran Gran!<br><b>Tenzin:</b> Oogi, yip yip!<br><br><i>(Oogi takes flight. Katara turns toward the camera and watches them fly off. Saddened, she rubs her eyes. Cut to a shot of Korra stop Naga at the edge of a precipice. As she watches the sky-bison flyby, Naga whines. Cut to a shot of Korra's back. We see now that she's looking out at a cloudy seascape. Again, the White Lotus is monitoring her from a distance. </i><br><br><i>Cut to a close-up on Korra's face. She's slumped over, chin resting against crossed arms.</i><br><br><i>Her expression hardens.</i><br><br><i>Cut to an overhead shot of the compound at night, specifically the part where Naga is stabled. Korra goes into Naga's pen and makes a beeline for her saddle. Just as she's fixing the straps on Naga, Korra is interrupted. She bodily cringes and turns.)</i><br><br><b>Katara:</b> Nice night for an escape, isn't it?<br><br><i>(Katara stands at the gate to the pen. She smiles in acceptance as Korra explains herself, which relieves Korra.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> I have to leave. I have to find my own path as the Avatar.<br><b>Katara:</b> I know you do. Aang's time has passed. My brother and many of my friends are gone. It's time for you and your generation to take on the responsibility of keeping peace and balance in the world. But I think you're going to be a great Avatar. <br><br><i>(Katara puts a hand on the Avatar's shoulder. Korra leans down slightly and hugs her mentor.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Thank you.<br><br><i>(Cut to close-up on Katara's face as they hug. Her eyes are closed.)</i><br><br><b>Katara:</b> Goodbye, Korra.<br><br><i>(Cut to a shot of the compound in the background. In the foreground, the snows part from underneath as Korra and Naga dig back to the surface. Korra leads the way. Naga shakes off the snow and then she's mounted. The duo race off-screen, stage left. </i><br><br><i>Cut to an overhead shot of Korra's family home. She and her parents are standing outside in the night, hugging, as warm light from inside has them cast long shadows together. Cut to a brief close-up of the family.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Mom, Dad. I'll miss you.<br><b>Senna:</b> We love you so much.<br><br><i>(Cut to Korra remounting Naga, her parents little more than silhouettes against their front door. Korra's gaze lingers on them for a moment, then she turns herself and Naga away, expression pained.</i><br><br><i>Cut to an establishing shot of a gold-trimmed red, white, and blue steamship cutting through the seas. A full moon hangs in the background of a partly cloudy sky. Cut to a cargo hold within that ship, with a green-colored car taking center stage. The car is secured to the floor with stakes and rope. The camera pans right, and half-hidden behind a wall of crates are our stowaways. Cut to Korra, arms behind her head, leaning against a sleeping Naga. Cut to a close-up on Korra. She's grinning and her eyes seem fixed on some distant point well beyond the realm of this cargo hold. Cut to an overhead shot of the steamship as it moves through the sea. Fade in on a sideways shot of the same ship, with the rightward horizon taking on the twilight of an impending dawn. </i><br><br><i>Cut back to a shot of Naga and Korra sleeping. The ship whines and groans, waking Korra. She rubs her eyes and then springs to her feet.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Naga, we're here!<br><br><i>(Cut to a shot of a door being lowered. The sunlight outside seems to burn its way into the gloomy cargo hold. A reaction shot of Korra hiding behind some crates has her flinch at the brightness, shielding her eyes. Squinting, she turns and darts away. As a man with a clipboard oversees some men manually unloading the crates, a white blur darts past them. They look up from their work, surprised. Cut to Naga bounding down the steel gangplank, knocking over one man as she goes.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Thanks for the ride! <br><br><i>(Cut to an overhead shot of Naga racing down a dockside along what look to be rail or trolly lines. Electrical lines crisscross the docks. </i><br><br><i>Cut to the big establishing money shot of Republic City. With their backs to us, Naga ambles alongside the edge of the river. The camera pans left along a suspension bridge, ending with a shot of the city's downtown: towering skyscrapers that gleam in the morning sunlight, with older brick skyscrapers at their feet, and zeppelins putter along to and fro overhead. </i><br><br><i>Cut to a shot of the traffic jammed suspension bridge, where cars -- or rather, 'satomobiles' -- are in stop and go traffic. The United Republic, incidentally, drives on the right-hand side of the road. Next we cut to a shot of Korra's and Naga's backsides as they walk up to a railing overlooking Yue Bay. The suspension bridge we just looked at is now at the far-right, as is a sort of Tokyo Tower-esq landmark. Korra, and the camera, are focused on Aang Memorial Island off in the bay, where a giant green statue of Aang stands.</i><br><br><i>Cut to a close-up of Aang's upper-body. An odd musical note sounds, rather like a gong, and when we cut back to Korra she's wide-eyed, as if mesmerized. Cut back to the shot of the bay and the statue, followed by a quick pan leftward to Air Temple Island.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Wow, look at this place, I've never seen so many satomobiles. Air Temple Island. That's where Tenzin lives. You ready for a little swim girl?<br><br><i>(Naga sniffs the air, then darts off to the right. Cut to an airship passing overhead, followed by a pan down to a busy avenue. Naga darts onscreen, running against the flow of traffic, and a few satomobilies swerve out of her way. There's some mayhem of a near collision, followed by a shot of Naga running past a sidewalk full of gawking pedestrians, with Korra looking embarrassed. Finally, Naga reaches her destination by tracking down the curious scent to an orange tent.</i><br><br><i>An inside view of the tent shows Naga's gigantic snout pocking through, followed by her head and, atop that, Korra.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Ok! Ok! Food first, then air temple. Watch it Naga! Look out! Oops, sorry about that. Excuse us. Coming through. Heads up. Eh, sorry, we're new in town. Naga, wait. <br><br><i>(Naga looks abashed by her mistress's command. Korra hops off and comes around to the side of the tent. She picks up some meat on a stick.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> We'll take one of everything please.<br><b>Shop Owner:</b> That will be 20 yuans.<br><b>Korra:</b> I don't have any money. <br><br><i>(The shop owner hulks out on Korra, snatching the meat on a stick away from her. Despairing, Korra walks away with her head hanging. Going back to Naga's side, the two of them walk towards the camera.)</i><br><br><b>Shop Owner:</b> Then what good are you to me?!<br><b>Korra:</b> Don't worry girl, this city's huge. I bet we can find a place to rustle up something to eat.<br><br><i>(Cut to three fish impaled on sticks; in the background, Naga forages with her head underwater in a small pond. Korra reaches out from behind the camera and flash-cooks each fish with her firebending. She picks up the middle fish-on-a-stick and, in the background, Naga comes up with a live fish in her jaws.</i><br><br><i>Cut to an establishing shot of a public park. It's a bucolic scene. The leaves on the trees have turned red and gold in the autumn. In the background is the towering skyline of Republic City.</i><br><br><i>Cut to Korra squatting at the side of the pond, baking a fish with her firebending. Behind her, there's a rustling in a bush. A wild-haired man rises out of it. Cut to Korra biting into the fish, her eyes turning towards the camera as she catches sight of this bush man. Cut to a view of them both on the pond's shore.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(gasp)</i><br><b>Park Hobo:</b> Uh, say, think I can get one of those tasty smelling fishies?<br><br><i>(The hobo ambles out of the bush, snatches a fish with a grin once he's given permission, and sits down. He immediately launches into consumption of said fish, devouring it typewriter-style.) </i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Oh, uh, yeah sure. So, do you .. live in that bush?<br><b>Park Hobo:</b> Yes, presently that is what I do call home. Took me a while to procure a bush that beautious. This park is quite popular with all the vagabounds.<br><br><i>(The bush sparkles.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> So, there are a lot of you out here? I thought everyone in the city was "living it up."<br><b>Park Hobo:</b> Hahaha! You've got a lot to learn newcomer. Welcome to Republic City. <br><br><i>(Korra is confused. This is not what she expected to learn. Then a whistle sounds. The camera jumps to the lelft, where a pudgy cop stands on a bridge over a small stream. He points at Korra and then starts running towards her.) </i><br><br><b>Police:</b> Hey, you! Stop! You can't fish here!<br><b>Park Hobo:</b> You best skedaddle!<br><br><i>(Cut back to Korra and the hobo. He hops up, goes over to his bush, and dives in. Korra whistles for Naga and they run off. The cop shortly gives up the chase as the exertion leaves him bent over, gasping for breath. Behind him, the hobo pops out of the bushes and waves goodbye at Korra.</i><br><br><i>Cut to Korra riding Naga through another section of the park. There's a fountain nearby. Cut to a man with a megaphone standing on a table before a poster of Amon. A dozen or so people stand around him, listening. Naga halts as they amble nearby. Korra is listening.)</i><br><br><b>Antibender Protestor:</b> Are you tired of living under the tyranny of benders? Then join the Equalists! For too long, the bending elite of this city have forced non benders to live as lower class citizens. Join Amon, and together we will tear down the bending establishment. <br><br><i>(When she starts talking, all heads turn towards her. There's a back-and-forth between her and the protester.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> What are you talking about? Bending is the coolest thing in the world!<br><b>Antibender Protestor:</b> Oh yeah, let me guess. You're a bender.<br><b>Korra:</b> Yeah, I am.<br><b>Antibender Protestor:</b> Then I bet you'd just love to knock me off this platform with some waterbending, huh?<br><b>Korra:</b> I'm seriously thinking about it.<br><b>Antibender Protestor:</b> This is what's wrong with this city! Benders like this girl only use their power to oppress us.<br><br><i>(The crowd jeers Korra, who's confused and annoyed.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> I'm not oppressing anyone! You're... you're oppressing yourself.<br><b>Antibender Protestor:</b> That didn't even make sense!<br><br><i>(Korra rides off, the jeering crowd to her back. Cut to a sleepy side street with several shops and street stalls. Korra is walking beside Naga now. She walks over to an older woman sitting with someone and asks for directions. Before she can get them, there's the roar of an engine. Cut to a nearby street-corner, where a red car pulls around into sight. Cut back to Korra and the older woman, who warns off Korra and then makes herself scare.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Excuse me, I think I'm lost. How do I get to Air Temple Island from here?<br><b>Shop Woman:</b> Just head down this street. You should get moving young lady, it isnt safe. <br><br><i>(Cut to a close-up of the red satomobile as it parks. Its front grill is decorated with a lion-turtle's face. Three thugs exit the car. Cut to a view of a male shopkeeper polishing a red phonograph. The three thugs freak out the shopkeeper, who drops his rag. Cut to a close-up of the three smiling thugs.)</i><br><br><b>Waterbending Thug:</b> Mr. Chung, please tell me that you have my money, or else i cant guatentee i can protect your fine establishment. <br><b>Mr. Chung:</b> I'm sorry, business has been slow. Please, take one of my phonographs.<br><br><i>(The one with the red scarf bends some fire in the palm of his hand.</i><br><br><i>Cut back to the shopkeeper. He tries to appease the thugs, but the red scarfed man wordlessly destroys the offered phonograph with a flaming kick. The shopkeeper screams and falls backwards.)</i><br><br><b>Waterbending Thug:</b> My friend here is not a music lover. Give me the money, or else...<br><b>Korra:</b> Or else what hoodlum?<br><br><i>(The thugs turn around, as does the camera, zooming about-face to see Korra standing behind them, hands on hips. Cut back to the thugs, who after staring for a moment glance at each other and start laughing. </i><br><br><b>Waterbending Thug:</b> Hahaha! Since you're obviously fresh off the boat, let me explain a couple things. You're in Triple Threat Triad territory, and we're about to put you in the hospital.<br><br><i>(Some cuts around the street, showing shopkeepers watching this exchange from their hiding places. The thugs, however, aren't pleased when Korra talks back to them.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> You're the only ones who are gonna need a hospital. And for your sake, I hope there's one nearby.<br><b>Waterbending Thug:</b> Who do you think you are?<br><b>Korra:</b> Why don't you come and find out.<br><br><i>(Korra, fist in palm, stares back confidently at the lead thug. Cut back to him. His eye twitches, and the camera snaps back as he hollers and reaches into his coat for some water. He attacks Korra with it, who catches the water in her left hand and tosses it back in his face. The water envelopes his head and freezes, leaving his partners with their jaws on the ground. He staggers around, but Korra defeats him with a single kick, throwing him against the front of his car. The ice enveloping his head and thrown-off hat shatters against the decorative lion-turtle face. He slumps against the car. He partners stare on for an instant, disbelieving, before the tall one with the pale green shirt turns to Korra and tries to attack her with his earthbending. Only Korra is already in motion; she rockets him into the air on a pillar of stone. The camera pans up as the earthbender thug flies high into the sky. </i><br><br><i>Cut to the old shopkeeper lady and her friend. They're staring up into the sky.)</i><br><br><b>Shop Woman:</b> What just happened?<br><b>Shop Man:</b> Did she just earthbend? <br><br><i>(Cut to the earthbender thug hitting every branch while falling down the preverbal tree. When he's finally kissing the pavement, the red-scarfed thug turns back to Korra and blasts her with fire. Cut to Korra leaping through the flames, a smile on her lips. She grabs the firebender's hands and he screams like a little girl.  Cut back to the shopkeeper duo. Their eyes go a little wider as they being to grasp who Korra is.)</i><br><br><b>Shop Woman:</b> Can she firebend too?<br><b>Shop Man:</b> Could she be...?<br><br><i>(Cut to Korra swinging around the firebender she's grappling with, then tossing him across the street and through the rice paper windows of a clock shop. He takes out two giant clocks on display as he goes down. Korra saunters up to the now-open air shop.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Got an idea about who I am now, chups? <br><br><i>(Suddenly there's the revving of an engine. Korra looks to the left. Cut to a sideways shot of Korra standing outside the shop as the trio's red car swevers towards her. Korra moves out of the way. The earthbender thug yells at the firebender to get in, but the waterbender won't slow down the car, and in the end the earthbender catapults the firebender into the car using a pillar of bent earth.)</i><br><br><b>Earthbending Thug:</b> Come on!<br><b>Korra:</b> You're not getting away!<br><br><i>(Korra takes off running after them, then jumps into an earthbending form. Ripping up the road, she flips the trio's car with some earthbending. The car lands right-side up, but the attack causes it to drive into a storefront.</i><br><br><i>Cut to smoke clearing, revealing the car wreck. As Korra jogs into sight of them, the door pops open and the thugs flop onto the ground in a heap. Immediately a siren sounds. Naga starts to howl in sympathy. Korra looks up and we cut to a worm's-eye view of an airship flying overhead in the blue sky. A sideways shot of the airship shows a door opening, and we cut to the backs of metalbenders as they leap out from that door mid-flight. They deploy metal lines, slowing their descent as they land, then retract those lines into the sleeves of their uniforms.</i><br><br><i>As the thugs stagger out of the ruined shopfront, Korra gestures to her quarry. The cops trap the trio in metal wires. Then the lead metalbender walks up to Korra and points at her.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Cool, metal benders. I caught the bad guys for you, officers.<br><b>Metalbending Cop 1:</b> Arrest them! You're under arrest too!<br><br><i>(Cut to a zoom in on Korra's shocked expression.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(gasp)</i><br><br><i>(Fade to black for commercial break.)</i><br><br><br><br><u><b>Act III</b></u><br><br><i>(We return to a shot of both Korra and the lead metalbender cop. Korra backpedals, growing defensive.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> What do you mean I am under arrest? Those are the bad guys over there, they were smashing up a shop!<br><br><i>(Cut to an overhead shot of the street. We can easily see the ripped up road, the swerving tread-marks, and the smashed shopfront the Triads drive through.)</i><br><br><b>Cop:</b> From the looks of it, you smashed up a lot more than that.<br><br><i>(The cop shoots metal wire at Korra. She dodges and grabs the line, holding it. They tug at one another.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Wait, you... you can't arrest me, let me explain!<br><br><i>(Cut back to the cop. He retracts the wire into his sleeve.)</i><br><br><b>Cop:</b> You can explain yourself all you like down at headquarters.<br><br><i>(Cut back to Korra in front of the smashed storefront. She retreats as the cop comes at her, whipping his wires, but the assault is interrupted by Naga, who comes around and body checks the cop from behind. A reaction shot shows the other cops aghast. They quickly run to their partner's defense. Korra hops on Naga and they run for it. One cop takes a flying jump at them, but Korra puts her boot to his face and kicks him back. One cop comes to the aid of the kicked officer, while the second man shoots his wires at some overhead lines, pulling himself up and then skating alonge the metal in hot pursuit of Korra. Civilian bystanders gasp as the chase rushes past them.</i><br><br><i>Cut to the camera zooming close over a tiled roof, below in the background is Naga racing toward a bridge. As the camera zips past the edge of the roof, the tiles burst off the roof. They are knocked off by the metalbender, jumping off the roof and shooting a line at Korra. Cut to that line wrapping around her warrior's wolftail and yanking her head back. Grimacing in pain, Korra throws her hands back, whipping up pillars of ice from either side of the bridge she's crossing. Cut to metalbender's eyes going wide as he zooms face-first into the ice. His hold on Korra's hair goes slack. She looks back. Cut to the shadowed form of the cop sliding down the ice sheet, the spot opposite where he hit it spiderwebbed from the impact. Cut to Korra facing forward, a bit of a smile on her face.</i><br><br><i>Naga gallops down the street, at the edge of which is a staircase that she runs up. Cut to an overhead street at the top of that staircase. A green car swerves to a stop to dodge the polar bear-dog crossing the street. Cut to a shot of Korra atop Naga, racing alongside some buildings, and two metalbenders dropping down onto 'skating' lines. Korra peels towards the camera. Cut to Naga racing down a street, then jumping off a bridge and onto a passing train. Naga struggles with her foot for a moment, but comes out on top of the train. Korra sighs in relief.</i><br><br><i>Cut to a shot of Air Temple Island off in the bay. In the foreground, utility lines and the tops of buildings blur past it. Cut back to Korra as a shadow passes over her. A siren sounds and she looks up. A police airship is lowering itself down towards her. Cut back to Korra, her face set with determination. As the elevated train turns a corner, Naga leaps across a gulf to a building's roof. Yet even as they land, a web of metal lines encircles Naga, yanking them both high into the air. As Korra starts to react, a second tangle of lines traps her.</i><br><br><i>Cut to a sideways shot of Korra and Naga entangled in wires beneath a moving airship. They both struggle for a moment, then slacken as their defeat sets in.</i><br><br><i>New scene. An establishing shot of Republic City Police HQ, a wide, low building. As Lin Beifong starts to speak, we cut to a close-up shot of a statue standing at the center exterior of the HQ. It's an adult Toph wearing a police uniform, immortalized in bronze.</i><br><br><i>Cut to an elaborate-looking interrogation room. Korra, shoulders hunched, sits with her hands cuffed to a table. Chief Lin Beifong, holding a clipboard, walks behind the seated Avatar. She slams the clipboard down on the table and gives Korra the stink eye.)</i><br><br><b>Lin:</b> Let's see, multiple counts of destruction of private and city property... not to mention evading arrest. You're in a whole mess of trouble young lady.<br><b>Korra:</b> But there were some thugs threatening a helpless shop keeper and I had to...<br><b>Lin:</b> Can it! You should have called the police and stayed out of the way.<br><b>Korra:</b>  But I couldn't just sit by and do nothing. It's my duty to help people. See, I'm the Avatar.<br><br><i>(Cut to Lin standing up, right Korra in the right-hand foreground.)</i><br><br><b>Lin:</b> Oh I am well aware of who you are. And your Avatar title might impress some people, but not me.<br><br><i>(Cut back to Korra. Collecting herself, she shifts from cowed to determined.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Alright, fine. Then I want to talk to whoever's in charge.<br><br><i>(Cut back to Lin. She takes a seat opposite Korra.)</i><br><br><b>Lin:</b> You're talking to her. I'm Chief Beifong.<br><br><i>(Cut to a full view of the interrogation room and of both women. Korra snaps upright when she makes the connection who Lin is.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Wait, Beifong. Lin Beifong? You're Toph's daughter!<br><b>Lin:</b> What of it?<br><b>Korra:</b> Then why are you treating me like a criminal? Avatar Aang and your mother were friends, They saved the world together.<br><b>Lin:</b> That's anciet history... and it's got diddle squat to do with the mess you're in right now. You can't just waltz in here and dole out vigilante justice like you own the place!<br><br><i>(A small section of the far wall open. A male cop's face appears. Both women look to him.)</i><br><br><b>Cop:</b> Chief, Councilman Tenzin is here.<br><b>Lin:</b> <i>(sigh)</i> Let him in.<br><br><i>(Cut back to a shot of Lin sitting at the table. She stands and turns. The wall behind her pulls apart in pieces, revealing Tenzin on the other side. Cut to a close-up on Tenzin. His expression is a disgruntled one. Cut to an over-the-shoulder shot of Korra taken from Lin's perspective. Korra tries to put a good face on her nerves.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Tenzin, sorry... I got a little side tracked on my way to see you.<br><br><i>(Cut back to Tenzin. He arches a bushy eyebrow and his eyes shift over to Lin. Tenzin stifles his annoyance and tries to be pleasant. The camera cuts to a side shot of him and Lin.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> [takes a deep breath] Lin, you are looking radiant as usual.<br><b>Lin:</b> Cut the garbage, Tenzin. Why is the Avatar in Republic City? I thought you were supposed to be moving down to the South Pole to train her?<br><br><i>(Cut back to Tenzin, who grows annoyed. Cut to the same over-the-shoulder shot of Korra, who slumps in defeat at Tenzin's mood.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> My relocation has been delayed. The Avatar, on the other hand, will be heading back to the South Pole immediately, where she will stay put.<br><b>Korra:</b> But!<br><br><i>(Cut to a view of all three. Lin stands with her back to the camera, hands held behind her.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> If you would be so kind as to drop the charges against korra, I will take full responsibility for today's regrettable events, and cover all the damages.<br><br><i>(Cut to a shot over Tenzin's shoulder of Lin and Korra. The police chief turns her head aside for a moment, as if weighing whether she should go along with this or not, but then she exhales and unlocks Korra's cuffs with a wave of her hand. Crossing her arms, Lin scowls at Tenzin. In the background, Korra rubs her wrists.)</i><br><br><b>Lin:</b> Fine. Get her out of my city.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> Always a pleasure, Lin. Let's go Korra.<br><br><i>(Tenzin turns and walks out. Korra follows him, not quite able to take her eyes off Lin as she passes by her. Cut to Lin doing an "I'm keeping my eyes on you" gesture at Korra. Cut to a reaction shot, where Korra makes a stink face and returns the gesture, then tromps out of the room. Cut back to Lin, whose surprise shifts into a "that didn't even make sense" look.</i><br><br><i>Cut to a waiting room in the Police HQ. A tiny elderly woman sits on a bench with a giant platypus-bear on a leash seated beside her. </i><br><br><i>Cut to a shot of Tenzin and Korra standing in front of some station desk. Cut to Korra making dramatic hand gestures as she explains herself.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Tenzin, please, don't send me back home.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> You blantanly disobeyed my wishes, and the orders of the White Lotus<br><b>Korra:</b> Katara agreed with me that I should come. She said my destiny is in Republic City.<br><br><i>(Cut to Tenzin. He freaks out, spittle flying everywhere as his head goes red like a chili pepper.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Don't bring my mother into this!<br><br><i>(Cut back to a shot of both of them. As Korra continues to talk with her hands, Tenzin strokes his long goatee, clearly considering her words.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Look, I can't wait any longer to finish my training. Being couped up and hidden away from the world isn't helping me become a better Avatar. I saw a lot of the city today, and it's totally out of whack. I understand now why you need to stay. Republic City does need you, but it needs me too.<br><br><i>(Tenzin tries to respond to her earnest appeal, but he can't quite put words together. He lamely looks away. They're both distracted by the arrival of a policeman escorting Naga. The policeman looks decidedly unhappy with his lot in life at the moment. Cut to a close-up on them as Naga licks the officer's hair, slicking it with his saliva and twirling it so that it looks like he has ice cream piled on top of his head.) </i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> You... ugh...<br><b>Police Officer:</b> Is this your polar bear dog, miss?<br><br><i>(New scene. A twilight exterior shot of Aang Memorial Island. A junk sails past it. In the background, Republic City is alight. Cut to a close overhead shot of Tenzin as he stands at the railing of the junk, looking up at his father's statue. The look on Tenzin's face is sad, almost a touch mournful. Cut to a shot from Tenzin's POV, looking up at the giant looming statue of Aang against a cloud sunset sky. Cut back to Tenzin. He seems to sigh. Then he turns around and the camera cuts to a view his fellow passengers. Naga is asleep. Korra, meanwhile, stands at the railing and stares at Republic City with her back to the camera.</i><br><br><i>Cut to a shot of Air Temple Island. It's a bit later now; the gloamin, when the sun has set but the world still holds a bit of light in the deep purple of twilight's end. The junk has docked on a pier with electric floor lights. Also docked is a steamer ship, smaller and functional-looking rather than the gilded titanic steamer Korra stowed-away on earlier in the episode. Cut to three White Lotus men stand on the dock; behind them their steamer ship has lowered a gangplank. Cut to Korra looking at them. She's anxious, but sighs in acceptance. Cut to an overhead shot of them all as Korra, a tiny figure now, begins walking towards the White Lotus. Suddenly two gliders cut into shot. Cut to a shot of the gliders landing: Ikki first, then Jinora with Meelo riding piggyback. They collapse their gliders and rush over to Korra. Ikki and Meelo immediately hug her legs. Jinora holds back for a moment, then joins her siblings.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin's Kids:</b> Korra!<br><br><i>(Cut to a close-up on Ikki. She's excited. Cut to a view of the girls' backs. Korra, with a hand on each of their shoulders, kneels down.)</i><br><br><b>Ikki:</b> Are you coming to live with us on the island?<br><b>Korra:</b> No, I'm sorry Ikki. I have to go home now.<br><b>Ikki:</b> <i>(disappointed)</i> Oh...<br><br><i>(Cut to Tenzin. His expression shifts almost imperceptibly at his eyes; sadness, maybe. Cut to a rear shot of Tenzin and his children as they watch Korra go to meet the White Lotus. Cut to a shot of a sad Korra walking alongside Naga, one hand on her for support. When Tenzin speaks, Korra is shocked for a second before recomposing herself. She turned back toward Tenzin. He walks over to her. Cut to a shot of Tenzin and Korra's back. He puts a hand on her shoulder, and her expression is surprised. Then Korra's jaw drops from joy. </i><br><br><i>Cut to a side shot of both of them and Tenzin's children. As they cheer, Korra effortlessly scoops them and Tenzin up in her arms and lifts them into the air. Naga comes over and rubs her head against Korra's back. Cut to a close-up on Tenzin. He sighs, uncomfortable but patient.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Wait. I have done my best to guide Republic City towards the dream my father had for it, but you are right. It has fallen out of balance since he passed. I thought I should put off your training in order to uphold his legacy, but you are his legacy. You may stay and train airbending here with me. Republic City needs its Avatar once again.<br><b>Korra:</b> Yes! Thank you! You're the best!<br><b>Tenzin's Kids:</b> Yay!!<br><br><i>(New scene. A daytime exterior shot of City Hall, with a large cheering crowd in front of it. Cut to a shot of the crowd where photographers hold up old-style flash bulbs as they snap shots. Cut to a shot of an anxious Korra at a podium outfitted with five microphones. Cut to a shot from Korra's back of the crowd before her. Cut to several fast shots of reporters asking her questions.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Hello, I'm Korra, your new Avatar. <br><b>News Reporter 1:</b> Does this mean you've moved to Republic City?<br><b>News Reporter 2:</b> Were you trying to send a message to the Triads yesterday?<br><b>News Reporter 3:</b> Will you be fighting crime or the anti bending revolution or both?<br><b>News Reporter 4:</b> Will you be working with Chief Beifong and the police?<br><br><i>(Cutting back to Korra, she's struggling to say something coherent. Then she gathers herself and begins to talk more comfortably. Cut to a wide shot of Korra on the steps of City Hall as the reporters snap more photos. At her right is Tenzin. At her left are Naga and Chief Beifong.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Uh, yes, I am definitely here to stay, but honestly, I don't exactly have a plan yet. See I'm still in training... but... look, all I know is Avatar Aang meant for this city to be the center of peace and balance in the world, and I believe we can make his dream a reality. I look forward to serving you! I am so happy to be here. Thank you Republic City!<br><br><i>(Cut to a radio tuned to Korra's press conference. An Equalist sits behind the radio, chin resting on folded hands as he listens. There are footsteps and a hand reaches over to turn off the radio.

Fire. Air. Water. <i>(Each of the latest four Avatars --Kyoshi, Roku, Aang, and Korra-- demonstrate the bending of their native element in front of the corresponding symbol.)</i> Only the Avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world. <i>(Aang's statue is visible in the Republic City's bay before the camera pans to show Korra standing in line with it.)</i><br><br><br><br><i>[Previously on "The Legend of Korra" sequence, including clips from "Welcome to Republic City".]</i> <br><br><b>Radio Broadcaster:</b> Republic City welcomes a new citizen into our arms, Avatar Korra! After years of seclusion in the South, this master of water, earth, and fire seeks to add airbending to her list of skills. And under the tutelage of Tenzin, Avatar Aang's son, she should go far. But will this cool, calm, collected master of air be able to tame this hot headed teen?<br><br><br><br><u><b>Act I</b></u><br><br><i>(It is morning over Republic City's bay. The camera pans down to show a Sky Bison descending past Air Temple Island's tower. Korra's voice starts as the scene shifts to show her reading a newspaper inside.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(excited)</i> -and in the final round, the Buzzard Wasps won with a decisive knockout. <i>(lowers the paper and looks across her table to Tenzin)</i> What do you say we go to the arena tonight, catch a few pro-bending matches?<br><br><i>(The camera shifts to a wider view, showing that Korra and Tenzin are seated together at one of several tables in a communal dining area. Air Acolytes of both genders are dressed in red and yellow robes, eating and drinking together.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> That sport is a mockery of the noble tradition of bending.<br><b>Korra:</b> Come on Tenzin. I've dreamed about seeing a pro-bending match since I was a kid, and now I'm just a ferry ride away from the arena. <i>(motions out the window behind her to the golden Pro-bending Arena across the bay)</i><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Korra, you're not here to watch that drivel, you're here to finish your Avatar training. So for the time being I want you to remain on the island.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(slumped, leaning her head on her hand with a dejected expression)</i> Is that why you're keeping the White Lotus sentries around, to watch my every move?<br><br><i>(The view pans out further to show one White Lotus sentry standing guard at a door in the background, while two more flank the camera's view in the foreground.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Yes. In order to learn Airbending I believe you require a calm, quiet environment, free from any distractions.<br><b>Korra:</b> Alright, you're the master.<br><br><i>(Korra turns around to look out of the window, a reluctant look on her face. The camera follows her gaze, zooming in on the standout edifice of the Pro-bending Arena.<br><br>The scene changes to an exterior covered pathway on Air Temple Island. Tenzin and Korra are walking along, while a lemur flies by them. Korra is wearing a classic Airbender outfit, but she has the sleeves rolled up to completely expose her arms.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> So, my mother informed me that you've never been able to Airbend before.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(stops abruptly and sighs, before motioning dramatically)</i> Yeah, but I don't know why, the other elements came so easily to me. But every single time I've tried Airbending... <i>(Korra sticks her tongue out and blows a raspberry, then puts a hand on her hip.)</i> Nothing.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(puts a hand on Korra's shoulder)</i> It's perfectly alright, we just need to be patient. <i>(starts casually pulling Korra's sleeves back down to their proper length)</i> Often the element that's most difficult for the Avatar to master is the one most opposite to the Avatar's personality. For Aang it was Earthbending.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(dejected)</i> Yeah, well, I'm about as opposite an Airbender as you can get.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(starting down the path again)</i> Let's begin your first lesson.<br><br><i>(The pair ascends a set of stone steps to arrive at the Airbending training area, where Ikki, Jinora, and Meelo are waiting in front of the stilled Airbending Gates. The ëgatesí are a cluster of large wooden panels- all decorated identically with the Airbending symbol- mounted on poles so that they stand straight up. Meelo is waving happily while Ikki is jumping excitedly with clasped hands. Jinora is simply standing at attention with her hands behind her back.)</i><br><br><b>Ikki:</b> Korra's gonna Airbend, Korra's gonna Airbend!<br><b>Korra:</b> What is that contraption?<br><b>Tenzin:</b> A time honored tool that teaches the most fundamental aspect of Airbending. Jinora, would you like to explain this exercise? <br><b>Jinora:</b> <i>(steps towards the Airbending Gates)</i> The goal is to weave your way through the gates and make it to the other side without touching them.<br><br><i>(The view pans across the wooden panels)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(smiles)</i> Seems easy enough.<br><b>Ikki:</b> <i>(speaking quickly)</i> Jinora forgot to say you have to make it through while the gates are spinning.<br><br><i>(Tenzin steps forward, and circles his bent arms in front of his body. The Air responds to his motions, and when he suddenly pushes his open palms forward, a large gust of wind erupts towards the Airbending Gates, setting them all spinning rapidly. The camera closes in on the many spinning panels, then returns to Tenzin, who now has a small green leaf in his hand. He holds it up towards the gates, and lets it go to ride the wind. As he speaks his lesson, the leaf is carried right into the twirling gates, but passes through without touching any of them.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> <I>(voice over)</I> The key is to be like the leaf. Flow with the movement of the gates. Jinora will demonstrate. <i>(As Tenzin continues the lesson, Jinora nimbly enters the Gates. She moves between the spinning panels in a circle-walking style, spinning and turning as needed to easily avoid every panel. With each step, she cycles which of her palms is held out in front of her.)</i> Airbending is all about spiral movements. When you meet resistance, you must be able to switch direction at a momentís notice.<br><br><i>(Once she has emerged from the Gates, Jinora turns around, and thrusts out another gust of powerful Airbending, powering the spinning panels back to full speed.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Let's do this.<br><br><i>(Korra eagerly runs forward, but without any discernable stance or style. She runs headfirst into the closest panel, and hits it hard enough to ricochet into the next panel beside her. Tenzin winces, and Korra gives in to panic and breaks out into a full sprint that once again crashes into a Gate. She proceeds to do an impressive impersonation of a pinball in a machine as she stumbles out of control into a series of panels. She finally gets tossed out of the gate area completely and lands hard on her backside.<br><br>The camera shifts to show everyone looking at her. Tenzin's face gives nothing away, but Meelo is smiling and Ikki has a look of horror about her. With a groan, she gets back to her feet in the foreground, and with an angry look, runs back towards the Gates. She barely gets by the first pair of panels before she is again caught by one and sent careening around.)</i><br><br><b>Jinora:</b> <i>(shouting through cupped hands)</i> Don't force your way through!<br><br><i>(Korra gets hit by another panel.)</i><br><br><b>Ikki:</b> <i>(clenching her fists and motioning expansively)</i> Dance, dance like the wind!<br><br><i>(Korra gets hit by another panel.)</i><br><br><b>Meelo:</b> <i>(waving his arms with an undulating motion)</i> Be the leaf!<br><br><i>(Korra gets hit by another panel. She ricochets around a few more times, before stumbling back out of the Gate area. There are dark circles around her eyes, and she has a punch-drunk expression on her face. She collapses flat on her back in front of Tenzin and the kids. Tenzin gives a heavy sigh and shakes his head.<br><br>The scene shifts to a nighttime view of the whole Air Temple Island. Even in the low light, flying Sky Bison are visible in the air above the island. A cut reveals Korra practicing aggressive Airbending motions just outside the main Temple buildings.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Airbend. <i>(The view zooms out, to reveal that not only did the move have no effect, but her target is a newspaper strung up on a line so that a picture of Chief Lin Bei Fong is prominently displayed.)</i> What is wrong with me? Airbend. <i>(Korra tries again, and the view shifts to a close-up of a bored Naga. When the view returns to Korra, her eyes are wide and she is shaking with frustration. Finally, she punches a fireball at the newspaper and incinerates it.)</i> Ugh, maybe I'm just not cut out to be an Airbender, huh, Naga?<br><br><i>(Suddenly, the sound of a radio announcer carries through the night air, catching Korra's attention. She looks around and finds a lit-up guard shack a short distance behind her.)</i><br><br><b>Shiro Shinobi:</b> <i>(voice over)</i> Ladies and gentlemen I'm coming to you live from Republic City's pro-bending arena, where tonight the best in the world continue their quest for a spot in the upcoming championship tournament.<br><br><i>(The scene cuts to a close up of the radio in question, within the guard shack. The view changes to show three White Lotus sentries clustered around the radio, then pans upward to reveal Korra crouched on the shack's roof, settling in eagerly.)</i><br><br><b>Shiro Shinobi:</b> <i>(voice over)</i> Grab your snacks, and grab your kids, because this next match is gonna be a doozy.<br><br><i>(The scene fades into a time jump, revealing that Korra is still listening as she gazes with relaxation at the distant Republic City.)</i><br><br><b>Shiro Shinobi:</b> <i>(voice over)</i> This Mako's got moxy. He advances, fires two quick shots, <i>(cut to shot of the White Lotus sentries leaning with smiles over the radio)</i> Yomo is hammered back to zone three. <i>(cut to shot of Korra leaning with an identical expression)</i> The clock is winding down, can Yomo hold on? <i>(cut back to the guards, who are pressed closer together with wide eyes)</i> He's teetering on the edge of the ring now. <i>(cut back to Korra with a wide grin and clenched fists)</i> The Fire Ferrets line up to strike--<br><br><i>(The view briefly shows the radio's lit dial, but it goes dark as the announcer abruptly cuts off. Korra's expression falls and her irises shrink with disappointment. Back in the guard shack, the surprised White Lotus sentries turn around to find Tenzin standing behind them with the radio's unplugged power cord in his hand.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Korra, come down here, please.<br><br><i>(Korra peaks down from over the roof's awning. The White Lotus sentries finally notice her, and leap back with surprise as she flips herself down to the ground.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(frustrated)</i> You shut it off at the best part!<br><b>Tenzin:</b> I thought I made myself clear, I don't want you listening to this distracting nonsense.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(walking to Tenzin but motioning at the White Lotus sentries)</i> But it's their radio, and technically you said I couldn't watch a match, you didn't say anything about listening to one.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> You... <i>(growls)</i> You know what I meant. Anyway, shouldn't you... shouldn't you be in bed by now?<br><br><i>(Tenzin abruptly turns around, sending a wind through the shack as he snaps his cape in place.<br><br>The scene cuts to the morning. The camera shows the rocks at the base of Air Temple as Sky Bison fly by, and pans up to the Meditation Pavilion. In the gazebo on the edge of the cliff, Tenzin is crouched with eyes closed in a meditative position. Opposite him, Jinora, Ikki, Meelo, and Korra are seated in similar manners. Korra reaches around to scratch her backside. She goes back to meditating, but soon starts sniffling. After another moment, she peaks a look at the Airbender children beside her. Finally, she gets back to a whole full second of meditating before slumping forward and opening her eyes.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> I think I'm doing it wrong.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(close up view, opening his eyes)</i> There's nothing to do. Let your mind and your spirit be free, for air is the element of freedom.<br><br><i>(Korra gives a sarcastic, thigh-slapping burst of laugher.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b>Is something funny?<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(crossly)</i> Yeah, you're telling me to embrace freedom but you won't even let me listen to the radio. And forget about leaving this island.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> Please, Korra. Look at Meelo, he is able to meditate peacefully.<br><br><i>(Korra looks next to her at Meelo, and a close-up reveals that his head is slumped, he's breathing heavily to inflate a bubble of snot out a nostril, and drool is leaking out of his open mouth.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Actually I think he's asleep.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> What? <i>(leans forward to look at Meelo)</i> Well at least he has the relaxing part down.<br><b>Korra:</b> Whatever. None of this Airbending stuff makes any sense to me.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> I know you're frustrated but these teachings will sink in over time. Then one day they'll just click.<br><br><i>(Korra takes a deep breath and goes back to meditating. She lasts three seconds before sighing and slumping forward.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Yeah, it's not sinking in yet. <i>(stands up and walks away)</i> I'm gonna go get a glass of lychee juice.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(sternly)</i> Korra, the meditations not over yet.<br><b>Ikki:</b> Daddy, can I have some lychee justice too? <i>(smiles and clasps her hands endearingly)</i><br><b>Tenzin:</b> No.<br><br><i>(Ikki pouts, Jinora sneaks a look out of one eye, and Meelo begins tottering in place.)</i><br><br><b>Meelo:</b> Ohhhhh.<br><br><i>(Meelo falls backward to sprawl across the ground, still asleep.)</i><br><br><i>(The scene cuts to night. White Lotus sentries are on station around the Air Temple. Korra peaks out of a second-story window, and drops to the ground once she ascertains that none of the guards will see her. She dashes for a nearby cliff, and keeps going straight over the edge. As she falls towards the bay, she sweeps her arms upward in a Waterbending motion. The bay water rises in a funnel to catch and ease her below the surface. Korra transitions into an undulating swim that quickly carries her towards Republic City. The camera pans up to reveal her target, the golden Pro-bending Arena. Floodlights arc through the sky as the camera zooms in rapidly.<br><br>Fade to commercial break.)</i><br><br><br><br><u><b>Act II</b></u><br><br><i>(The scene starts with another look at Air Temple Island, and pans over to the Pro-bending Arena. The building rests on a wooden pier out in the bay, connected to the rest of Republic City by a long boardwalk path. Korra emerges from the waters right next to the Arena, and looks up at a series of tall windows on the building's upper stories. One of the windows is open, and Korra smiles with satisfaction. She spins in the water, creating a spiraling Waterbending funnel that shoots her straight through the window to land lightly on her feet. Shaking herself dry, she sets off down the hallway.<br><br>Korra stops when she finds an open doorway into a large gym. Among the equipment are punching bags, dumbbell weights, nets, pommel horses, and earth disks. Korra smiles and enters the gym without hesitation, looking around at everything. She is surprised by a voice from behind.)</i><br><br><b>Toza:</b> Hey! What are you doing in my gym? <i>(The camera shifts to reveal Toza. He is wearing a towel around his neck.)</i><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(friendly)</i> Uh, I was just looking for a bathroom and I got lost.<br><br><i>(As Korra and Toza converse in the foreground, a Pro-bender all done up in his uniform and pads walks by in the background. He catches sight of Korra, and comes to an interested stop.)</i><br><br><b>Toza:</b> <i>(pointing)</i> Ah, the old ëI had to peeí excuse. <i>(The background Pro-bender, still unnoticed, runs a smoothing hand through his hair.)</i> You know, I'm sick and tired of you kids sneaking in and not paying. I'm taking you in to security.<br><br><i>(The background Pro-bender enters the gym and approaches the arguing pair with a smile. As he comes into focus, the face of Bolin is revealed.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(panicked)</i> No, wait!<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(waving to Korra)</i> There you are! I've been looking everywhere for you. It's all right, Toza, she's with me.<br><b>Korra:</b> Yeah, I'm with him.<br><b>Bolin:</b> So, you see, we're together.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(worried)</i> Well, not ëtogetherí together. More like friends.<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(surprised and blushing with chagrin)</i> Right, friends. No, no, I didn't mean to imply-<br><b>Korra:</b> Oh, you implied it.<br><b>Toza:</b> <i>(throwing his hands up with exasperation)</i> Ah, I don't care what you are. I've got work to do. <i>(walks a short distance away and throws his towel to the floor. Korra's eyes follow him as he uses his Bending to lift and throw a special dumbbell with spherical canisters on each end instead of weights.)</i><br><b>Bolin:</b> Right this way, miss.<br><b>Korra:</b> And thank you sir. <i>(whispering and covering the side of her mouth conspiratorially)</i> Seriously, thanks.<br><br><i>(Bolin leads Korra out of view. The scene shifts to their arrival in another room. Korra looks around curiously.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> What do you think? Best seats in the house, huh?<br><br><i>(The camera zooms out to reveal that they're in a Pro-bender locker room, situated even with the main playing field and open on one side to offer a great view.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Whoa! Unbelievable! This place is even more amazing than I imagined.<br><br><i>(In the background, Mako and Hasook enter the room in their Pro-bending uniforms.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Name's Bolin by the way.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(distracted and looking around)</i> Korra.<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(whispering)</i> Psst, Bolin.<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(going over to Mako)</i> Yeah?<br><b>Mako:</b> I told you. <i>(putting on a pair of padded gloves)</i> You have to stop bringing in your crazy fangirls in here before the matches. Get her out of here.<br><b>Bolin:</b> Ah, come on Mako. All right, look, I kinda promised her she could stay. But man I've got a good feeling there's something special about her. I know it.<br><br><i>(Bolin goes back to Korra, and guides her to over to face Mako.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b>Come here, I want you to meet my brother, Mako.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(smiling, impressed)</i> Mako? Wow, I heard you play on the radio. <i>(Korra holds out her hand to shake, but Mako walks right by her, putting his helmet on.)</i><br><b>Mako:</b> Come on, Bolin, we're up.<br><b>Korra:</b> Or I could meet him later.<br><b>Bolin:</b> Yeah, sorry about that, my brother just gets real... focused before the match. Okay, I've gotta go. Wish me luck. Not that I'll need it.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(laughs)</i> Good luck. Knock em' out.<br><br><i>(Korra offers a punching salute as the three Pro-benders emerge out into he arena. The view switches to an overhead view of the arena, and the lights all shut off expect for the spotlights shining down on the playing field itself. From a rising platform in the middle of the field, the announcer rises with a microphone in hand.)</i><br><br><b>Ring Announcer:</b> Introducing the Fire Ferrets.<br><br><i>(The Announcer points to one end of the field, where an extending platform carries the three Fire Ferrets forward. Mako waves to the crowd with a small smile, while Hasook sports a grim expression as he waves. Bolin grins fiercely, and holds up a hand to his ear in a mock call for more noise. The crowd roars and applauds.)</i><br><br><b>Female Fan:</b> <i>(voice over)</i> Ahh! I love you Bolin! Ahh!<br><br><i>(The scene shifts to Shiro Shinobi in his observer's office.)</i><br><br><b>Shiro Shinobi:</b> The rookie Ferrets came from out of nowhere and made it further than anyone expected this season. <i>(The scene shifts around to show the Ferrets talking their place on their side of the field, while Korra watches with delight from the locker room. Shiro Shinobi's commentary continues as a voice over.)</i> But tonight, they face their toughest test yet folks. <i>(The two Pro-bending teams line up on either side of the field's center line and assume hunched Bending stances with fists held high. In the background, a referee on a platform signals for the match to begin and a bell clangs.)</i> And they're off. <i>(The two teams leap back to the back of their first 'zone' and start flinging elements at each other. Bolin summons an earth disk from a slot in the floor and kicks it over to a Firebender Tigerdillo, who blocks with a fire wave.)</i> The two teams waste no time trying to blast each other out of zone one. <i>(The Tigerdillo Firebender throws a fireball across the midline, forcing Hasook to roll out of the way. As he jumps, he summons water from a stream beneath a grate in the floor.)</i> Hasook is the first to feel the heat of the Tigerdillos. <i>(His Tigerdillo target dodges, then kicks an earth disk back across the midline.)</i> He tries to return the favor but they're too fast for him. While Mako showcases his trademark cool-under-fire style.<br><br><i>(The view lingers on Mako, who dodges blasts of all three elements by bobbing and weaving in place. The action slows as Mako draws tight and punches out a powerful fireball, then returns to normal speed. The attack passes out of the scene, but two Tigerdillos come forward beneath the fire and throw their elements at Hasook and Bolin. Both attacks hit and knock the Ferrets off their feet. In landing, Hasook and Bolin tumble into the second zone, prompting a buzzer to sound and the zone border to light up.)</i><br><br><b>Shiro Shinobi:</b> <i>(voice over)</i> The Tigerdillos score with a walloping one-two combo. <i>(quick cut to an anguished Korra, clutching her head with both hands)</i> Can their teammate hold on for their zone one territory? <i>(Mako dodges elemental attacks with flying leaps, but after a series of backflips is hit by an earth disk and slides back so that one foot is just over the zone's back line. The buzzer sounds and the border lights up again.)</i> Guess not; Mako's over the line. The Tigerdillos get the green light and advance into Ferret territory.<br><br><i>(The center line of the field lights up green, and all three Tigerdillos step forward into first zone of the Ferret's side of the court.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(pumping her fist in the air)</i> Come on Ferrets!<br><br><i>(The Pro-benders are once more trading attacks. Bolin fires an earth disk over, but it is deflected back with a kick by the Tigerdillo Earthbender. The disk hits Hasook, knocking him into the final zone.)</i><br><br><b>Shiro Shinobi:</b> <i>(voice over)</i> Look's like Hasook's in trouble. He's in zone three teetering over the brink. <i>(Hasook lands just short of an opening at the back of the field, and the overhead view reveals an artificial lake below. After the buzzer, the playing continues. The Tigerdillo Waterbender kicks a disk of water at the Ferrets, and while the others dodge it, Hasook is knocked off his fit by the impact. An earth disk attack immediately follows up, and Hasook is knocked over the edge and into the water below.)</i> And Hasook takes a dip. He'll be back for round two- assuming the fabulous bending brothers can hold their ground until the next round.<br><br><i>(Mako and Bolin cluster together before splitting apart again to dodge water and earth attacks. Bolin tries to block another water attack with a disk that he kicks up in front of him, but the water breaks through the shield and knocks him back into zone three. Mako follows shortly after taking a hit of his own. With that, the bell clangs repeatedly, and the view shifts to a series of four tall light bulbs. The first on the right lights up blue, revealing writing. The crowd cheers.)</i><br><br><b>Ring Announcer:</b> Round one goes to the Golden Temple Tigerdillos!<br><br><i>(The Ferrets take their places back in their first zone.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(annoyed)</i> Come on Hasook, get you're act together.<br><br><i>(The bell clangs and the next round starts. The Tigerdillos immediately attack one after another, and all three attacks connect with Ferrets and push them immediately back into the next zone. )</i><br><br><b>Shiro Shinobi:</b> <i>(voice over)</i> The Fire Ferrets are knocked into zone two and the Tigerdillos advance. <i>(The attacks immediately start again, and as Bolin punches an earth disk forward, the view goes into slow motion. A Tigerdillo fires off a short stream of water, but is hit in the stomach with the disk. Bolin punches two fireballs out, and Hasook kicks out a pair of water lashes that knock another Tigerdillo to the floor. Bolin sends out another disk that hits the center Tigerdillo and sends him back to zone three. Simultaneous fire and water attacks from the other Ferrets send the other two Tigerdillos back to join the first, and the bell clangs as the speed returns to normal.)</i> The Fire Ferrets cinch the round in the closing seconds. <i>(Bolin and Hasook cheer, but Mako just tries to catch his breath. Sweat is visible behind his helmet's face shield.)</i> It's one a piece. Still anyone's match as we go into the third and final round. <i>(A vertically split screen shows the two teams lining up again. The round starts with the bell, and all the Pro-benders leap back. The Tigerdillo Waterbender targets Hasook, who dodges two water attacks and winds up stumbling across the field.)</i> Hasook stumbles, and now he tumbles right into his teammate. <i>(Another water attack pushes Hasook onto Bolin and knocks both of them to the floor. Hasook lands facing down on top of Bolin, and both look panicked.)</i> He and Bolin better untangle quick if they don't wanna- oh, too late.<br><br><i>(The Tigerdillo Earthbender kicks a disk at the two tangled Pro-benders, striking them as they're in the process of getting back up. Both are sent flying out the back of the field and land in the water.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(clutching her face)</i> Oh, no!<br><b>Shiro Shinobi:</b> It's all up to Mako now. <i>(The Tigerdillo Waterbender kicks a shot at Mako, who dodges under it. Additional attacks of all three elements come at him as he runs across the arena, ducking and spinning to avoid every attack.)</i> He's bobbing and weaving, he's weaving and bobbing, but he's not hitting back. <i>(Mako is backed up against the edge of the field. His right foot is placed just short of the fall into the pool below.)</i> If Mako's knocked out the Ferretsí fabulous season is over. <i>(Mako pants for breath.)</i><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(pulling her own hair-danglies down, expression strained)</i> Ohhh!<br><b>Shiro Shinobi:</b> <i>(voice over)</i> He is dancing on the edge of the ring, surviving the three on one barrage. <i>(The view is back to Mako, who is bobbing and weaving around attacks of all three elements.)</i> It seems his plan is to let the Tigerdillos punch themselves out. <i>(Mako finally throws a fireball back.)</i> And his plan is working! <i>(The fireball passes right through the Tigerdillo Waterbender's prepared water, turning it to steam, and continues to slam into the Pro-bender's chest and send him tumbling straight over the back edge of the field.)</i> Hahn is in the pool, they've got nothing left in the tank and Mako is on the offensive! <i>(Mako rushes forward with a steady progression of strong fire attacks, culminating in an extra large flare generated with both arms.)</i> It's two on one! <i>(Although the remaining Tigerdillos block some of his attacks, the Firebender takes a hit, flies backward into the railing, and bounces out the back and into the water.)</i> Scratch that it's one on one, and it's an earth and fire slugfest. <i>(The Tigerdillo Earthbender and Mako both go on the offensive, tossing attacks with abandon. The attacks all collide over the field's centerline, causing the disks to explode. Mako kicks an especially strong attack into the dust cloud, connecting with the Tigerdillo and pushing him back into his zone three.)</i> There's so much smoke and dust from the fire fight I can't even see where the Fire Ferret is. <i>(Mako comes leaping out of the dust cloud and brings down a flaming fist that pushes a wave of fire right into the Earthbender's chest just as he is about to launch a disk. The last Tigerdillo crashes back over the edge to fall into the water. The bell clangs, ending the game, and the crowd roars.)</i> It's a knockout! What a wingdinger of a hat trick, folks! <i>(The view zooms out to show Mako standing alone in the field, then cuts back to the score-keeping light bulbs. The last three are lit up red.)</i> Mako pulls off the upset of the season, winning the match for the Fire Ferrets.<br><br><i>(The camera spins around Mako, who cooly takes off his helmet and looks out at the cheering crowd. The view cuts back to Korra, staring wide-eyed with admiration, a small smile on her face that blossoms into an open-mouthed grin.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(leaping back into the locker room)</i> Woohoo, yes! One more win and we're in the championship tournament. <i>(snaps fingers, and then calms down)</i> So, what'd you think Korra? <i>(taking his helmet off)</i> Bolin's got some moves, huh?<br><b>Korra:</b> What did I think? <i>(grabs Bolin roughly)</i> What did I think? <i>(shoves Bolin away)</i> That was amazing!<br><br><i>(As Bolin stumbles back, the camera pans to reveal Mako and Hasook walking back from the arena into the locker room. Mako has taken his helmet off, but Hasook is still wearing his.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(angry)</i> You did more harm than good out there. You almost cost us the match.<br><b>Hasook:</b> We won didn't we? <i>(takes helmet off)</i><br><b>Mako:</b> Barely.<br><b>Hasook:</b> Get off my case, pal. <i>(Hasook throws his helmet to the floor, growls, and continues to walk right out of the locker room.)</i><br><b>Mako:</b> Useless.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(turning to look from Hasook's exit to Mako, her smile quickly returning)</i> You guys were incredible out there. Especially you, Mr. Hat Trick. <i>(points with both hands at Mako)</i><br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(not even looking at Korra)</i> Oh, you're still here?<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(frowns with disappointment)</i> Oh, you're still a jerk?<br><b>Bolin:</b> Oooh, ha ha.<br><b>Korra:</b> Anyway. <i>(perking up and turning back to Bolin)</i> I've been immersed in Bending my entire life but I never learned how to move like that. It's like there's a whole new style here. Think you could show me a few tricks?<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(excited, relishing the word)</i> Absolutely.<br><b>Mako:</b> Right now? Come on Bolin.<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(aside, from behind his hand)</i> Just ignore him. <i>(smug)</i> Yeah, I could show you the basics. I'm just not sure how my Earthbending would translate to your Waterbending. But we'll figure it out.<br><b>Korra:</b> Won't be a problem. <i>(crosses her arms over her chest)</i> I'm actually an Earthbender.<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(blinks with surprise, then becomes awkward and embarrassed)</i> I'm sorry, no, no. I didn't mean to assume. Cause I, ya know, I was just figuring, with your Water Tribe getup... that you are... a water tribe... gal.<br><b>Korra:</b> No, you're right I'm a Waterbender... <i>(arches an eyebrow)</i> and a Firebender. <br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(puts a hand to his chin, thinking it over calmly)</i> Mmmhmm. I'm very confused right now. <br><b>Mako:</b> You're the Avatar, <i>(lowers his head and closes his eyes)</i> and I'm an idiot.<br><b>Korra:</b> Both are true.<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(shocked, cycling through exaggerated facial expressions)</i> No... way. <i>(aside to Mako, pointing at Korra)</i> The Avatar!<br><br><i>(The view briefly goes outside to the Pro-bending Arena's exterior, still glowing gold in the night sky.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(voice over)</i> Alright, let's see what you got.<br><br><i>(The scene returns to the interior, now in the Pro-bending gym. Bolin has shed his Pro-bending gear so that he's down to a tank-top shirt, pants, and boots. A few rips are visible in the shirt. He stands beside two stacks of earth disks and motions to Korra. She floats a disk into the air with an upraised fist, and then throws it at a distant net with a punch, immediately following it with a second attack. Both projectiles hit the netting at about the same spot.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(impressed)</i> That was great. Good power. But in a real match you'd be a sitting turtle duck. <i>(Still in her horse-stance, Korra frowns.)</i> Not so upright and flatfooted. <i>(Bolin takes a stance like a boxer, legs bent, fists held in a high guard over his face. He throws a couple of practice punches as he talks. The view is zoomed out to reveal Mako a short distance away, leaning against a ladder-staircase. He is dressed similarly to Bolin.)</i> Stay light on your toes, right up until the moment when you need to dig in and strike. Then... <i>(He throws a pair of stronger punches, and two earth disks leap up and fly straight at the camera.)</i> Pop, pop.<br><br><i>(The camera follows the flying disks as they curve slightly through the air, hitting the net just as they intersect. When the view comes back to Korra and Bolin, the Avatar is staring slack-jawed at the display. Bolin smiles and waves at the net.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Okay. Let me try it again.<br><br><i>(Korra looks down at her feet, and mimics Bolin's bent-legged stance, giving a few short hops. Then she braces herself with a twist of a foot, and throws a pair of strong punches that launch two more earth disks. The camera zooms out to retreat from their flight, revealing Mako still in the background, pointedly not looking at Korra or Bolin.<br><br>The disks hit the net in a similar manner to Bolin's previous shots. Korra puts her hands on her hips and looks back to Bolin.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(excited)</i> Wow, nice adjustment! You're a natural at this.<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(mostly off-screen)</i> Not bad.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(expression drooping)</i> What's it take to impress this guy?<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(eyebrows furrowing)</i> What? I said not bad. <i>(The view shifts briefly back to Korra to show her quizzical expression, then returns to Mako as he shakes his head.)</i> You know what, it's getting late. I think I'm gonna turn in. You kids have fun. <i>(As he talks, he walks away, but pauses to look back at Korra.)</i> Nice to meet you, "Avatar Korra."<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(waving, but with an amused expression and speaking sarcastically)</i> Yeah, been a real pleasure.<br><b>Mako:</b> See you upstairs bro.<br><b>Korra:</b> Upstairs? You guys live here?<br><b>Bolin:</b> Yup. In the attic. It's nothing fancy, but we have some great views. So, back to bending, why don't you throw that combo one more time?<br><br><i>(Korra takes her Pro-bending stance again, and throws another pair of disk-launching punches. They strike the net perfectly again, and Korra pumps her fists with victory and takes on a thrilled expression. The scene immediately transitions with a wipe that follows the spinning of one of the panels from the Airbending Gate. Korra is back on Air Temple Island at daytime, standing in almost the same pose, but she's now wearing her Airbender outfit, her expression is frustrated, and some of her hair is sticking up. Tenzin, Ikki, and Meelo stand visibly behind her, with Jinora eclipsed by Korrra.<br><br>Korra exhales angrily, clenching her fists, and makes another reckless dash at the Airbending Gates. She gets into the thick of the Gates when she once again slams into one, getting pushed into a spin that ricochets her around several more panels. The camera briefly switches to an upset Tenzin.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Patience, Korra.<br><br><i>(Korra stumbles backwards into another panel, and falls to the ground. She gets visibly angry, and rises into a Firebending attack at the Gates. She throws a flurry of punches that unleash fireballs all around her, then lets out a massive attack that explodes outwards and takes out all the spinning panels. The camera cuts to Tenzin and family, who are staring with shock, before returning to Korra. She is panting for breath, standing in the center of a cloud of smile while the wreckage of the Gates burns around her.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(shell-shocked)</i> That was a 2,000 year old historical treasure. <i>(furious)</i> What... what is wrong with you?<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(emerging from the Gates, angry and gesturing dramatically)</i> There's nothing wrong with me. I've been practicing just like you taught me, but it isn't sinking in, okay? It hasn't clicked like you said it would. <br><b>Tenzin:</b> Korra, this isn't something you can force. If you would only listen to me.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(screaming)</i> I have been! But you know what I think? Maybe the problem isn't me. Maybe the reason I haven't learned Airbending yet is because you're a terrible teacher. <i>(runs off screen)</i><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Ughh.<br><b>Meelo:</b> <i>(steps forward and points at Tenzin with a big grin)</i> Yeah, you're a terrible teacher daddy. <i>(runs into the wreckage of the Gates, and starts kicking and throwing pieces around with wild glee)</i> Wahh, ahh, ahhhh!<br><br><i>(Tenzin looks down with defeat, but Ikki and Jinora both move as one to solemnly hug him. Fade to commercial break.)</i><br><br><br><br><u><b>Act III</b></u><br><br><i>(It is sunset on Air Temple Island, and the Sky Bison are once more circling the sky above the grounds. Cut to Tenzin's family's dining room. A low table rests in the center, atop of which is an unused cooking pot. Tenzin is sitting at the table with his eyes closed and his arms crossed over his chest. Meelo, Ikki, and Jinora are also sitting at the table, but the latter is reading a book.)</i><br><br><b>Pema:</b> <i>(walking in with a tray of food)</i> Okay, everyone here? <i>(looks around)</i> Wait, where's Korra?<br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(puts a hand to his head, and speaks quickly)</i> Honestly Pema, I am  at my witsí end with that girl. IÖI don't know how to get through to her. <i>(slunps and looks down)</i><br><b>Pema:</b> <i>(going to Tenzin and putting an arm around him)</i> Dear, the best thing you can do right now is to give Korra some space. <br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(looking across the table to his children)</i> You must promise me that your teenage years won't be like this. <br><br><i>(The view cuts over to center on Jinora. She looks up from her book with lidded eyes.)</i><br><br><b>Jinora:</b> I will make no such promises.<br><br><i>(The scene cuts to the interior of the Pro-bending Arena. Three players are already standing out on the playing field, while the crowd hums. The scene moves to the locker room. Bolin and Mako are hanging out morosely, while another team is taking off their pads behind them. Korra enters through the door to no reaction.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> I didn't miss your match, did I? You guys look like you lost already.<br><b>Bolin:</b> We might as well have.<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(angry)</i> Hasook's a no-good no-show!<br><b>Pro-bending Referee:</b> <i>(peaking in through the door)</i> You have two minutes to come out ready to play or you're disqualified.<br><b>Mako:</b> Well, there goes our shot at the tournament... and the winnings.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(pointing at the other team)</i> Can't you ask one of those guys to fill in?<br><b>Bolin:</b> Nah, the rules say you can only compete on one team.<br><b>Korra:</b> Well, then... how about me? I'm a top-notch Waterbender, if I do say so myself.  <br><b>Bolin:</b> But, you're the Avatar. Isn't that cheating?<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(smiling)</i> It isn't cheating if I only do Waterbending. <br><b>Mako:</b> No way. I'd rather forfeit than look like a fool out there.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(glancing angrily at Mako)</i> Wow, thanks for the vote of confidence.<br><b>Pro-bending Referee:</b> <i>(peaking through the door, speaking quickly)</i> Times up. You in or out?<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(answering quickly)</i> We're in.<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(immediately interjecting)</i> We are?<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(immediately pumping his fists)</i> Yes!<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(surprised, looking at Korra and Mako as they hurry to the lockers)</i> Hey, I didn't agree to this.<br><b>Korra:</b> You can thank me later.<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(dour)</i> This girl is crazy.<br><br><i>(The scene cuts to the main arena. The camera is positioned just over Shiro Shinobi's shoulder, so that the referee is visible below, and the playing field beyond him. The Fire Ferrets taking the field.)</i><br><br><b>Shiro Shinobi:</b> Looks like the Fire Ferrets have ferreted out a last minute replacement Waterbender. <i>(now a voice over, as the scene zooms in on the Fire Ferrets; Korra is adjusting her pads, which are obviously too big for her)</i> Let's she if she's another diamond in the rough like the brothers from the school of hard knocks.<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(whispering as Korra takes her stance)</i> Don't do anything too fancy or aggressive. In fact, don't do anything. Just try not to get knocked off the ring.<br><b>Korra:</b> You got it captain. <i>(her helmet sags to cover her eyes, and she pushes it back up)</i><br><b>Pro-bending Referee:</b> Players, are you ready?<br><br><i>(The camera zooms out dramatically as the referee blows his whistle and motions to begin the match. Korra immediately grins and performs a strong horizontal kick that summons a heavy stream of water to pound one of the opposing players straight over side-ropes and into the pool below. He screams as he falls. The camera peaks at his fellow players, who look surprised and upset. A quick look at Mako and Bolin shows the older brother face-palming.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(jumping with fists raised victoriously in the air)</i> Woo-hoo, man overboard! <i>(starts running in a circle)</i><br><b>Pro-bending Referee:</b> <i>(blows whistle)</i> Fire Ferret Waterbender penalty. Move back one zone.<br><b>Korra:</b> What? Why?<br><b>Mako:</b> You're only allowed to knock players off the back of the ring, not over the sides!<br><b>Korra:</b> Oh... whoops.<br><br><i>(Korra moves back to zone two as the player she knocked out returns to his team's first zone. The bell rings to start the game again.)</i><br><br><b>Shiro Shinobi:</b> <i>(voice over)</i> And we're back in action after that hiccup. <i>(The two teams are trading elemental attacks. Korra takes an earth disk to the stomach, and slides back.)</i> But I'm not so sure this replacement player knows what she's doing.<br><br><i>(Korra rushes forward into a leaping kick that catches an incoming stream of water and tosses it back, but she lands with one foot back in zone one.)</i><br><br><b>Pro-bending Referee:</b> <i>(blows whistle)</i> Foul. Over the line. Move back to zone three.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(growls and punches the air as she moves back)</i> Argh. I'll show you over the line.<br><br><i>(Mako and Bolin watch her move back to the final zone. As the bell rings again, Bolin taps his fingers together with chagrin, as Mako merely looks down in resignation.)</i><br><br><b>Shiro Shinobi:</b> <i>(voice over)</i> The Platypus Bears take round one. <i>(The view shows the four score-keeping light bulbs, and one on the left lights up blue. The bell rings again to start the next round. The Platypus Bears immediately begin launching elemental attacks.)</i> The Platypus Bears know a green player when they see one, and they are focusing the brunt of their bending on this poor girl. <i>(Korra dodges and blocks a storm of attacks, getting forced from one side of the field to the other. She finds herself at the focal point of simultaneous fire and water attacks, and with a growl brings up a shield of earth disks to intercept the incoming elements.)</i> Wait a minute? Did that Waterbender just Earthbend?<br><br><i>(The crowd gasps in the darkened stands. Play stops as the Platypus Bears stare in shock. The referee's whistle blows as Korra looks around warily.)</i><br><br><b>Pro-bending Referee:</b> <i>(voice over)</i> Foul... I think?<br><br><i>(Korra gives a chagrined laugh and shrugs at the audience. Her helmet once again slips down over her eyes. Elsewhere on the field, Mako and Bolin stare with dismay, and Mako gives a weary sigh.<br><br>The scene shifts to a zoomed-out look at the guard shack on Air Temple Island. The porch is lit up, but the White Lotus sentries are all seated at a table outside under the night sky, listening to a radio positioned at the center.)</i><br><br><b>Shiro Shinobi:</b> <i>(from radio)</i> Did I see that right? Hold on folks, we're just waiting for the refereeís official call, but I think this replacement player could be-<br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(walking up to the guards from behind)</i> Pardon me everyone-<br><b>Shiro Shinobi:</b> <i>(from radio)</i> No, there's no way.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> -have you seen Korra this evening? She's not in her room.<br><br><i>(One of the guards starts taking a long drink from a cup)</i><br><br><b>Shiro Shinobi:</b> <i>(from radio)</i> You've gotta be kidding me, she's the Avatar folks, playing in a Pro-bending match. <i>(The drinking guards abruptly spits out her mouthful all over one of her comrades.)</i> Can you believe that?<br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(face reddening, eye twitching)</i> I'll get her myself!<br><br><i>(Tenzin turns around and stalks off with a swish of his cape and a trailing wind.<br><br>The scene cuts back to the Pro-bending Arena, where the referee steps forward to speak to the player and crowd.)</i><br><br><b>Pro-bending Referee:</b> <i>(raises hand)</i> The Avatar will be permitted to continue, so long as she solely bends water.<br><br><i>(The crowd cheers.)</i><br><br><b>Platypus Bears:</b> <i>(upset and gesturing)</i> Ohh, aww!<br><br><i>(The view cuts to the two teams all lined up for the latest round. The bell rings, and they once more go into action. The camera pans across the three Platypus Bears, who each launch an elemental attack as the camera focuses on them.)</i><br><br><b>Shiro Shinobi:</b> <i>(voice over)</i> This girl may be the Avatar, but she's no Pro-bender, and the Platypus Bears are intent on exploiting that weakness. <i>(The view follows Korra as she dodges and blocks another series of attacks, but this time she just sticks to water.)</i> Theyíre giving her their best, and her best ain't good enough to stop it. <i>(Korra tries to block a fireball, but it pushes her back and off balance. An earth disk hits her immediately after, leaving her open for a line of water that upper-cuts back. Two buzzers sound as she passes into zones two and three.)</i> Annnd she's in the drink.<br><br><i>(Korra goes right over the back of the field and into the pool. The view follows her as she swims underwater to a platform where she can pull herself out of the artificial lake. She just gets hold of the edge of the platform and leans onto it when a shadow falls over her, surprising her. The camera turns around and pans up to reveal Tenzin.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(nervous)</i> Oh, hey Tenzin. I thought you didn't like coming to these matches, ha ha. <i>(climbs fully out of the pool and onto the platform)</i><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Once again you have flagrantly disobeyed my orders. You were to stay on the island. Let's go. <i>(turns around to lead Korra away)</i><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(clenching fists)</i> No, I'm kind of in the middle of something.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> I have tried my very best to get through to you by being gentle and patient, <i>(angry)</i> but clearly the only thing you respond to is force! So I am ordering you to come back to the temple, right now!<br><b>Korra:</b> <I>(also angry)</I> Why, so I can sit around and meditate at how bad I am at Airbending? You know, I'm beginning to think there is a reason I haven't been able to learn it. Because maybe I don't even need it!<br><b>Tenzin:</b> What? That is a ludicrous suggestion! The Avatar needs to learn Airbending; it is not optional!<br><b>Korra:</b> No, this <i>(motions back towards the playing field, while the sounds of Pro-bending are audible)</i> is what I need to learn: modern styles of fighting.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> Being the Avatar isn't all about fighting, Korra. When will you learn that?<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(turns around)</i> I have a match to go finish. <i>(Korra walks to the elevator that will take her back up to the playing field.)</i><br><b>Ring Announcer:</b> <i>(voice over)</i> The Platypus Bears win round two! <i>(The scene cuts back to the playing field, where Korra is ready to go with her teammates. The two teams are lined up and the bells rings.)</i> Round three!<br><br><i>(The Platypus Bear Waterbender fires off a pair of attacks. The view cuts over to Bolin, who throws an earth disk and then takes one of the water blasts with crossed arms. He's pushed back, but stays steady. He comes to a stop near Mako, who is throwing and blocking attacks.)</i><br><br><b>Shiro Shinobi:</b> <i>(voice over)</i> The Platypus Bears come out of the gate and quickly go after the Ferret brothers. <i>(Mako and Bolin are pushed up against the ropes at the edge of the field. They alternate trying to throw attacks between blocking, but they start getting hit too often to do anything but hunker down. They get hit by several strong streams of water, but stay on their feet.)</i> Theyíre corralled in the corner, wedged in the edge of zone one, unable to come to the Avatar's rescue. <i>(The Platypus Bears' Firebender and Earthbender throw attacks at Korra. She dodges and blocks them with water whips, while Mako and Bolin take another strong hit of water.)</i> And boy does she need it. <i>(The view cuts to Tenzin, who is walking through the audience stands towards an exit. The crowd cheers, and Tenzin turns around in the exit tunnel to look at the ring. He sees Korra get hit and knocked back a zone by a strong blast of water, and he takes on a worried expression.)</i> Looks like the Avatar's Pro-bending debut is going to be cut short. <i>(Korra dodges a fireball and actually catches an earth disk in her hands that she throws away, but she is still pushed back. Tenzin sighs and face-palms.)</i> She's been pushed back to zone three, and the water is calling her name. <i>(Korra skids so that her feet are right up against the back edge of zone three. She teeters on the edge, ducking under an earth disk but nearly falling. She grits her teeth with determination, and steps back into the center of zone three.)</i> It's only a matter of time before- <i>(Korra starts circle-walking right in zone three, enabling her to easily step around the Platypus Bears' attacks. Her form is perfect, cycling her hands so that they alternate positions, and stepping easily to change direction instantly.)</i> Hold the phone, stop the presses, she's still in the game folks, and she's moving like an entirely different player. All of a sudden the Platypus Bearsí strikes are only striking air.<br><br><i>(The Platypus Bears focus exclusively on Korra, throwing attack after attack, but none of them so much as touch her, and she continues to calmly step around every disk, fireball, and water-stream. The view shifts and zooms in on Tenzin.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(quietly, stunned)</i> How about that.<br><br><i>(The view cuts back to the field, where a close up of the Platypus Bears shows them panting with exertion. They try to continue their barrage, but their movements are slow and lethargic, and the pace of their attacks has lessened considerably.)</i><br><br><b>Shiro Shinobi:</b> <i>(voice over)</i> The Platypus Bears have no juice left, <i>(The view cuts to other side of the field, where Mako and Bolin are still hunkered down with their arms crossed over their faces defensively. The latest stream of water doesn't even reach them, slowing midair and splashing to  the floor.)</i> but Mako and Bolin are still fresh and juicy. <i>(Bolin is surprised, but Mako immediately goes into action by jump-kicking out a wave of fire. He lands and pins the middle Platypus Bear with a series of weak attacks, and Bolin quickly joins him and throws an earth disk. The other team is pushed back, and the Waterbender is even knocked off his feet. Korra makes a spinning jump that catches an incoming stream of water and throws it right back. Mako throws three Fire attacks at his opposite number and knocks him out the back of the field. The Earthbender Platypus Bear gets hit by an Earth disk, and a water attack knocks him to zone two, then a fire attack keeps him tumbling straight over the edge. The Firebender takes a water hit and keeps his feet, but a second stream uppercuts him into the air and over the back edge. The camera watches from below as he falls into the pool. The bell rings, signaling the end of the round.)</i><br><b>Shiro Shinobi:</b> Knockout.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(excited, pointing dramatically with both hands at the playing field)</i> Woohoo! <i>(looks around, realizes what he's doing, and quickly stands straight and adjusts his cloak before walking out of the arena)</i><br><b>Shiro Shinobi:</b> <i>(voice over)</i> The Fire Ferrets come from way behind and steal the win! What an upset folks! <i>(The camera zooms out over the entire arena interior, then cuts to the score-keeping bulbs. They remaining bulbs light up red.)</i> The rookies, Avatar and tow, have nabbed a place in the championship tournament. I can not believe it!<br><br><i>(Korra looks around with joy, then the view cuts to Bolin, who is making exaggerated 'I can't hear you!' gestures at the crowd with his other hand on his hip. Korra walks over, and they laugh and high-five.)</i><br><br><b>Korra & Bolin:</b> Ah, ha, ha, yes!<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(walking over)</i> Korra, what can I say? You really came alive in that last round. The way you dodged their attacks, you are a natural. <i>(smiles)</i><br><br><i>(Bolin is waving to the audience in the background.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Thanks, but I can't take all the credit. <i>(smiles wryly as her eyes shift to the side)</i> Someone else taught me those moves.<br><br><i>(The scene changes to Air Temple Island. A half-moon is lighting up the night sky. The windows on the main temple and tower are lit. The camera pans over to the Airbending Gates. The restored panels are being re-installed on their spinners by Air Acolytes while Tenzin watches. Korra walks up to him from behind.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b>I'm really sorry, about everything I said. <i>(puts a hand to her chest)</i> I was really frustrated with myself and I took it out on you. <i>(motions to Tenzin)</i><br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(turns around to fully face Korra)</i> I think I owe you an apology too. I was trying to teach you about patience but I lost mine.<br><b>Korra:</b> No hard feelings?<br><b>Tenzin:</b> Of course not. By the way you were really good out there tonight. <i>(points at Korra, and waves his finger playfully)</i> You moved just like an Airbender. <br><b>Korra:</b> Wait, <i>(leans forward)</i> you stayed and watched?<br><b>Tenzin:</b> I did. Pro-bending turned out to be the perfect teaching tool for you.<br><br><i>(Korra smiles, and Tenzin returns it.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(jogs away and waves)</i> I'll see you tomorrow for Airbending practice, bright and early. <i>(turns around as she jogs)</i> And, by the way, I kind of permanently joined the Fire Ferrets and we're playing in the tournament in a couple of weeks.<br><br><i>(Korra runs down the stairs and out of sight.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(wide-eyed, sighs)</i> Ugh.<br><br><i>(The view fades to an exterior shot of the Pro-bending Arena's tower. The golden facade still glows in the night, but one of the tall rectangular windows is open to a darkened interior. Mako is sitting at the window, looking out at the camera. The view zooms in on him, sitting quietly, then cuts to show that his line of sight corresponds to Air Temple Island.<br><br>The view cuts over to Korra's room. She is seen from the back, leaning out of a hexagonal window with her head resting on one of her hands. She is looking out at the glowing Pro-bending Arena. A cut to Korra's face reveals she is smiling with shining eyes.)</i><br><br><br><br>[End Credits]<br>

With her new teammates, Mako and Bolin, the Fire Ferrets earn a place in the championship tournament. But meanwhile and anti-bender revolution brews in Republic City. Who are the Equalists and what nefarious plan does the mysterious man behind the mask have in store for our hero? <br><br><br><br><u><b>Act I</b></u><br><br><i>(The story opens with a zooming shot of the Probending Arena in the day. The scene jumps within to the training room. The Fire Ferrets are all wearing Probending pads.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(catching a medicine ball)</i> What's the big idea with making me train this early in the morning? The morning is evil.<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(catching the ball from Korra)</i> We're the rookies so we get the worst time slot in the gym.<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(catching the ball from Bolin)</i> And you're the rookiest of us all. We gotta get you up to speed if you want to survive in the tournament. Deal with it!<br><br><i>(Mako tosses the ball hard to Korra, who winces as she catches it and becomes annoyed.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> You deal with it!<br><br><i>(Korra tosses the ball back to Mako, who catches it, but he's knocked completely off his feet to land skidding on his back.<br><br>The camera shifts to show a satisfied Korra with her arms crossed, then pans over to the room's entrance, where Butakha is coming in.)</i><br><br><b>Butakha:</b> There are my little hard working street urchins. <i>(He walks over to the Korra and Bolin. Pabu is perched on Bolin's shoulder.)</i> It's an honor to finally meet you, Avatar. <i>(He puts a hand on Korra's shoulder as Mako joins the group.)</i><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(skeptical)</i> And you are...<br><b>Butakha:</b> <i>(sweeping his hat off his head in a showman's manner)</i> Butakha! I run this whole Probending shebang. <i>(Butahka replaces his hat and reaches into his coat for a stack of Republic City yuans. Korra walks away with an uninterested slump.)</i> Here's your winnings from last match. <i>(Butakha hands a grinning Mako the bills, but interrupts and wags a finger as Mako tries to take the money. As he continues to speak, Butakha continues to take back yuans off the top of the pile.)</i> Ah-ah! Not so fast. First, you owe me for the Avatar's new gear, ha, gym and equipment rentals for last month. Ah-ah! Rent on your apartment, and a personal loan for groceries.<br><br><i>(Mako turns an angry pout on Bolin, who shrugs in response.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> What? I'm a growing boy! <i>(rubbing stomach)</i><br><b>Butakha:</b> Oh! And one more small item of business. The Fire Ferrets need to ante up thirty thousand yuans for the Championship pot.<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(leans forward and his eyes grow wide)</i> Thirty thousand yuans!?<br><b>Butakha:</b> Sorry, kids. You've got till the end of the week to come up with the dough, or else, you're out of the tournament.<br><br><i>(He pats Mako on the shoulder, then walks away. Korra approaches Mako and Bolin again.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> You wouldn't happen to have a secret Avatar bank account, over-flowing with gold, would you?<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(turns her pockets inside out to show that they're empty)</i> I got nothing. I've never really needed money. I've always had people taking care of me.<br><b>Mako:</b> Then I wouldn't say you have nothing. <i>(He picks up the medicine ball, and packs it into an equipment bag.)</i><br><b>Korra:</b> Sorry, I didn't mean...<br><b>Bolin:</b> No, it's alright. It's just... ever since we lost our parents, we've been on our own.<br><b>Korra:</b> I'm so sorry. I didn't know.<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(zips the bag and throws it over his shoulder)</i> So anyway, how are we going to come up with the money?<br><b>Bolin:</b> Oh! Oh! I got it! <i>(He kneels down and holds Pabu upright against the camera. The ferret's arms droop cutely as Bolin swings him back and forth between Korra and Mako.)</i> I've been training Pabu to do circus tricks. Now people would pay good money to see that.<br><b>Mako:</b> Come on, Bolin. We need serious ideas.<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(quietly, lowering his gaze and bringing Pabu back in close to his body)</i> I was serious.<br><b>Mako:</b> Don't worry about it. I'll figure something out. I always do.<br><br><i>(Mako leaves as the other two watch him. The camera zooms in on Bolin's face, and he takes on a serious, determined expression.<br><br>The scene changes to Central City Station. The front of the station itself is in the background as the camera pans down over a very large statue of a young Zuko. The statue has one arm raised up, in which a real flame burns. Bolin is revealed to be sitting right in front of the statue, and when the camera shifts closer, it's clear that he's wearing circus-styling over his normal clothes, and has a ridiculously large handle-bar mustache on his face.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(gesturing dramatically)</i> Come one, come all! Come see Pabu, the Fantastic Fire Ferret as he crosses the ladder of peril! Gasp! Upside down. <i>(Pabu is standing on a cup next to a wooden plank suspended between two more cups. The ferret is grooming itself and misses Bolin's cue.)</i> Psst. <i>(Pabu leaps from the cup onto the plank and lands in a handstand. It walks easily across on just its front paws. Bolin coaches the ferret quietly but with excitement, gesturing for it to leap off at the end of the plank.)</i> Big finish, buddy. Stick the landing. <i>(Pabu jumps off the plank onto the sidewalk, landing on its right front paw and posing.)</i> Ta da! <i>(Several people walk by. The first one throws a single coin in the tin cup that Pabu started on, but the others ignore the scene.)</i> Thank you ladies and gentlemen! You are too kind. Seriously, too kind. You can come back here and put money in this, <i>(Bolin picks up the cup, and his faces droops as he shakes the single coin inside.)</i> Okay that's fine. That's fine. One yuan down, twenty-nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine to go.<br><br><i>(A red speedster Satomobile pulls up in front of Bolin. The window rolls down to reveal a man in a fancy blue jacket, Shady Shin.)</i><br><br><b>Shady Shin:</b> Hey, Bolin. Is that you?<br><b>Bolin:</b> Oh, hey there, Shady Shin.<br><b>Shin:</b> <i>(Gets out of the car and approaches Bolin.)</i> Heard you're a big time pro-bending player now. Not bad.<br><b>Bolin:</b> Uh, thanks.<br><b>Shin:</b> So listen, I've got an offer for you. Lightening Bolt Zolt is looking to hire some extra muscle.<br><b>Bolin:</b> Uh, I don't know, Shin. Mako told me to stay away from the Triple Threats.<br><b>Shin:</b> Pft, your brother ain't the boss o'you. It's just a little security work. Nothin' crooked.<br><br><i>(Shin reaches into his jacket and pulls out a stack of yuans, which he throws into Bolin's cup.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(wacky face)</i> Gasp!<br><b>Shin:</b> You game?<br><br><i>(The scene cuts to an industrial setting, where a man in a protective apron and mask is bending lightning into a large mechanical battery receiver. The camera shifts to show a line of such people, each finishing and immediately throwing another lightning bolt as needed. A steam whistle sounds, and the first figure lifts his mask to reveal Mako, who wipes sweat from his brow.<br><br>The scene changes again to the Probending Arena's exterior at sunset. The scene goes inside to Mako and Bolin's one-room apartment attic. Mako comes up the stairs and goes to sit down on a sofa. He has a bag in one hand.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Bo! I'm back! Picked up your favorite dumplings. <i>(sits down)</i> Ugh. Hey, I found some work down at the power plant. It's some decent money. <i>(He takes a dumpling from the bag and eats it, then talks with his mouth full.)</i> Bolin? You here, bro? Huh. <i>(He looks out the window behind him at Air Temple Island, and smirks.)</i> I bet the little lovebird is making a house call.<br><br><i>(Evening has progressed and the sky has darkened as the scene changes to Air Temple Island's exterior Airbending Training Area. Jinora and Ikki are using their Bending to power the Airbending Gates, while Korra circle-walks through the spinning panels. She steps and spins through the obstacle course, smoothly avoiding the panels.)</i><br><br><b>Jinora:</b> Good! Light on your feet!<br><br><i>(Korra gets through the Gates, and jumps down to where Jinora and Ikki are standing. She leans to rest her hands on her knees, and pants for breath. Ikki and Jinora shift to look behind the Avatar, where Mako is coming up the path.)</i><br><br><b>Ikki:</b> Ooo, he's cute.<br><b>Jinora:</b> <i>(smiling)</i> Korra, is that the handsome firebender boy that drives you crazy?<br><br><i>(The perspective shifts so that Korra is directly facing the camera, and Mako is walking towards the camera. Korra takes on an outraged, embarrassed expression as the girls keep talking.)</i><br><br><b>Ikki:</b> Does he drive you crazy in a bad way? Or does he drive you crazy like you like him? <i>(Leans forward and clasps her hands hopefully.)</i><br><br><i>(Korra suddenly Earthbends the ground beneath the girls, flinging them up and off screen. She quickly turns to face Mako, who has finally reached her. Korra raises a hand and tries to innocently clear her throat. As she starts talking, a giggling Jinora and Ikki land lightly in the background with their Airbending.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Ahem. Oh, hey, Mako.<br><b>Mako:</b> Have you seen Bolin?<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(dryly)</i> Nice to see you to. And no, I haven't seen him since practice. Think somethingís wrong?<br><b>Mako:</b> I don't know. <i>(looks off sceen)</i> Bolin has a knack for getting into stupid situations. Sigh See you later.<br><br><i>(Mako turns to leave, but Korra hurries to follow him.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Wait! I could, uh, help you look for him.<br><b>Mako:</b> Nah, I got it.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(grabs Mako's arm)</i> Hey, Cool Guy. Let me help you. We can take Naga.<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(turns to face Korra)</i> Who's Naga?<br><b>Korra:</b> My best friend! And a great tracker.<br><br><i>(The scene is now Republic City at night. The atmosphere is murky, with the city's color's washed out. A few windows provide light as Korra and Mako, riding one-behind-the-other on Naga's back, travel down the street.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Your best friend is a polar bear dog. Somehow that makes perfect sense.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(teasing)</i> I'll take that as a compliment, city boy.<br><br><i>(Naga brings them to Central City Station, to the same spot where Bolin had been sitting in front of Zuko's statue. The flame glows warmly in the dark. Mako looks around, and sees the sidewalks filled with people.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Well, this is his usual hangout. <i>(Mako slides down off Naga. He goes over to a group of children playing around a lamppost. Two of the children are pushing at each other, while a third crouches just behind one of them, causing the defeated child to trip. All the children laugh, including Skoochy.)</i> You guys seen my brother around here today?<br><b>Skoochy:</b> Perhaps. My memory is a little, foggy. <i>(He rubs his nose with his thumb and approaches Mako.)</i> Maybe you can help, clear it up. <i>(He raises a hand and motions towards himself greedily.)</i><br><b>Mako:</b> You're good, Skoochy. Huh. A real pro.<br><br><i>(Mako reaches into his pocket and pulls a bill out that he slaps into Skoochy's hand. Korra's jaw drops, and she leans forward for a closer look, before straightening and putting her hands on her hips grumpily.)</i><br><br><b>Skoochy:</b> <i>(slips the money into his vest)</i> Yeah, I seen him.<br><b>Mako:</b> When?<br><b>Skoochy:</b> 'Bout noon.<br><b>Mako:</b> What was he doing?<br><b>Skoochy:</b> He was performing some kind of monkey-rat circus. And then...<br><br><i>(Skoochy motions for more money. Mako and Korra trade glances before Mako gets another yuan out of his pocket and gives it to Skoochy.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> And then what? Why'd he leave?<br><b>Skoochy:</b> <i>(leaning toward Mako and covers his mouth with his hand so no one else can see)</i> Shady Shin showed up and flashed some serious cash. Bo took off with him in his hot rod. The Triple Threats, the Red Monsoons, the Agni Kais, all the triads are muscling up for something real big. Now that's all you're getting outta me!<br><br><i>(Skoochy runs off. The other kids follow.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> What's he talking about?<br><b>Mako:</b> Sounds like there's a turf war brewing. And Bolin's about to get caught right in the middle of it.<br><br><i>(Fade to commercial break.)</i><br><br><br><br><u><b>Act II</b></u><br><br><i>(Two trolleys pass at a crossing in the Republic City streets, pulling away to reveal Korra and Mako, back on Naga.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> So where are we headed?<br><br><i>(Naga runs along, passing over a bridge.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> The Triple Threat Triads' headquarters. Hopefully Bolin's there and nothing's gone down yet.<br><b>Korra:</b> Triple Threat Triad? I beat up some of those yahoos when I got into town. Why would Bolin get tangled up with-- <i>(Naga barks and surges forward, prompting some animal off screen to squeal.)</i> Whoa, Naga!<br><br><i>(Naga runs towards the camera as Korra tries to bring him under control, then Pabu runs across the foreground. Naga pursues the fire ferret around a street corner, finally forcing it up a lamppost and onto a street sign.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> That's Pabu!<br><b>Korra:</b> No, Naga! Pabu's a friend, not a snack.<br><br><i>(Naga calms, and Pabu comes back down the lamppost. The camera closes in on the ferret as it leans towards Naga, touching noses with the her. Both animals mollified, Pabu runs up Naga's head, passes Korra, and climbs up around Mako's neck. Both Mako and Korra are amused at the display.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(loses his smile)</i> We gotta hurry.<br><br><i>(The scene changes to another Republic City street, and pans down to the Triple Threat Triad's hideout. Mako and Korra approach the front door.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(stepping warily across the porch)</i> Something's not right. There are usually thugs posted out front. We better be cautious. <i>(Mako pauses at the door, and moves to press against the wall beside it. He motions Korra to join him, but she nonchalantly goes right up to the door and kicks it open. Mako looks at her in surprise, then follows her in. The room is abandoned, and some of the furniture is turned over.)</i> Bolin? You in here?<br><br><i>(A motor sounds from outside the building, surprising Mako and Korra. They follow the noise to a back door, which Korra kicks open, and upon emerging from the building find a team of Equalist chi-blockers on motorcycles escaping with a truck. The camera closes in on the truck, revealing that its rear door is open. Within, Bolin is tied up and gagged, with Shady Shin behind him. An Equalist chi-blocker steps in front of them and closes the door.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Bolin!<br><br><i>(Korra an Mako run after them, but the last two Equalist motorcycle-riders toss canisters that release an obscuring cloud of bright green smoke. Korra and Mako come to a halt, and the Equalists escape.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(Emerging from the smoke and coughing.)</i> Naga, come!<br><br><i>(Naga comes in from off camera, and Korra follows her. Naga runs out of the smoke-filled ally with Mako and Korra on her back. They give chase to the Equalists, and Mako tosses fireballs at the fleeing motorcycles, but the Equalists avoid the attack. Korra sits straight in the saddle and spins her bent arms in an Earthbending move, causing the ground beneath one of the motorcycles to pop up and ramp the vehicle high in to the air. The Equalist driver maintains control and lands safely before accelerating ahead.<br><br>The chase leads into a wide-open square. The rear-most pair of motorcycles turn and skid into a spin that allows the Equalists to face their pursuers. One tosses a bola at Naga, trapping all her legs together. Naga trips and lands jaw-first on the ground, flinging Korra and Mako into the air. Both skid forward on the road after they land, but they recover and look up in time to see the Equalists flipping through the air to attack them. Korra and Mako quickly get to their feet, and each one faces off with an Equalist.<br><br>Korra attempts to Firebend a shot at her Equalist, but the masked attacker sails over it with a spinning leap. The Equalist gets in close to Korra, who once again punches a sequence of fire-streams at her attacker. The Equalist ducks under the flames, and knocks Korra's arms to the side. Korra attempts a spinning, flaming drop kick, but the Equalist dodges to the side. When she lands, Korra performs a high fire-kick, and the Equalist does a kick of her own and catches Korra's leg, twisting her around and exposing Korra's unprotected side. The Equalist hits Korra up and down her body with a flurry of light punches.<br><br>Korra is left swaying and gasping by the attack, and the side of her body that was attacked droops out of control, including the arm. Korra does more aggressive Firebending with a punch, a sweeping kick, and a jump kick, but the Equalist continues to avoid it all with quick flips. Mako is seen fleeing from his own flipping opponent in the foreground as the camera spins around Korra's battle, before the view switches fully to him. Mako shouts in pain and clutches his right elbow, apparently having just been struck. He regains his composure as his Equalist opponent lands in front of him, and he tries to Firebend in defense, but the Equalist once again dodges and strikes up and down Mako's body with more jabs.<br><br>The camera cuts back to Korra, who is also being hit on her remaining good side, all the way down to her feet. She stumbles away, and her Equalist jumps up and kicks her with both legs, knocking her to the ground right beside a fallen Mako.<br><br>Naga is shown, still tied up, and growls with bared teeth. She bites down on the rope around her paws and pulls at it.<br><br>Meanwhile, Korra and Mako are both still on the ground, reduced to watching with worry as the two Equalists are approach with spinning bolas in each hand. The masked attackers are quickly crossing their arms back and forth in alternating open and closed positions, but just before they throw their weapons, Naga comes growling and leaping at them. She lands between her friends and the Equalists, roaring and chasing the enemy away.<br><br>Pabu leaps off Naga's saddle, and screeches its own attempt at an intimidating growl.<br><br>The two Equalists exchange looks, then leap away and throw more gas canisters, covering their escape with green smoke. They emerge from the artificial fog on their motorcycles and speed away.<br><br>Pabu climbs up Mako, while Naga puts her head against Korra, allowing the Avatar to grab on and be pulled up to her feet. Once upright on her own, Korra attempts a Firebending punch, but her movements are awkward and weak.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Argh! I can't bend! <i>(She tries to Firebend again, and her voice get louder and more panicked.)</i> I can't bend!<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(standing up)</i> Calm down, it'll wear off. Those guys were chi blockers. They're Amon's henchmen.<br><b>Korra:</b> Amon? That anti-bending guy with the mask?<br><b>Mako:</b> Yeah, he's the leader of the Equalists.<br><b>Korra:</b> What do they want with the Triple Threats?<br><b>Mako:</b> Whatever it is, it can't be good. <i>(Mako closes his eyes and clutches his forehead with one hand.)</i> Ugh, I can't believe Bolin got himself into this mess!<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(putting her hand on Mako's arm)</i>  Mako, we are going to save your brother. I promise you that.<br><br><i>(Mako closes his eyes briefly, and turns away from her.)</i><br><br><i>(The scene fades back to a montage of Korra and Mako riding Naga through various Republic City street locales. Eventually, Naga slows to a stop, panting, while Mako is rubbing his eyes wearily.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> We've been out all night. No sign of him.<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(insistent)</i> We've got to keep looking. But where?<br><b>Korra:</b> I have an idea!<br><br><i>(Korra prompts Naga back in another direction, and the scene shifts to show them arrive at Republic City park. No one is around at this time of night, but a decorative fountain is running at the center of the scene. Naga goes to the fountain and dips her head to drink from it. Pabu climbs down her head, and leans over to also get a drink. The view cuts to Korra and Mako, dismounted and leaning against the fountain's side.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> The first day I got into town I ran into an Equalist protester over there. <i>(points)</i><br><b>Mako:</b> And you think he'll know where Bolin is?<br><b>Korra:</b> It's our only lead right now.<br><br><i>(The scene transitions to show Naga lounging up against a tree just opposite the fountain, with Korra and Mako in turn sitting up against Naga. Mako's eyes are closed, and he has his arms crossed and legs stretched out. Korra's legs are crossed, and she's leaning forward and looking around nervously.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(leaning towards Mako)</i> So why is Bolin running around with the Triple Threat Triad, anyway?<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(eyes averted, nervously)</i> Well we, we used to do some work for them back in the day.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(surprised)</i> What!? <i>(leaning forward accusingly)</i> Are you some kind of criminal?<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(angry and motioning)</i> No. You don't know what you're talking about. I just ran numbers for them and stuff. We were orphans out on the street. I did what I had to do to survive and protect my little brother.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(looks down, speaking softly)</i> I'm sorry. It must have been really hard. Can I ask what happened to your parents?<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(sigh)</i> They were mugged. By a Firebender. He cut them down right in front of me. I was eight.<br><b>Korra:</b> Mako.<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(As he continues to speak, Mako pulls his scarf up to cover his mouth.)</i> Bolin's the only family I have left. And if anything happened to him...<br><br><i>(The scene cuts to a daytime view of the park's trees, seen from below. As the Propagandist begins speaking, the view shifts to show Korra and Mako asleep in the same place they were the previous night. Both are now leaning against each other, heads resting together.)</i><br><br><b>Propagandist:</b> <i>(chanting)</i> Equality now! Equality now! We want equality now!<br><br><i>(Korra and Mako wake up, and are surprised to find themselves snuggled together. Korra reacts more severely, crying out, waving her arms with panic, and scooting away as quickly as possible. Just as she awkwardly stifles her scream, the pair notice the Propagandist.)</i><br><br><b>Propagandist:</b> Non-benders of Republic City...<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(pointing)</i> That's the guy.<br><br><i>(The view zooms in on the Propagandist, who's back on his stand and shouting into a megaphone. Posters for the Equalists are hung up around the table, including a large one with Amon on it directly behind the Propagandist. Another plainclothes Equalist man is sitting behind the table, while a citizen walks away looking at a piece of paper.<br><br>Korra and Mako approach.)</i><br><br><b>Propagandist:</b> ...Amon calls you to action! Take back your city! It's time for the -- <i>(gasp)</i> It's you again! You can not silence me, Avatar.<br><br><i>(Korra immediately slaps the megaphone out of his hands, sending the Propagandist hopping back with a scared yelp. The megaphone falls to the ground and shatters into many pieces.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Shut your yapper and listen up. My friend got kidnapped by some chi-blockers. Where'd they take him?<br><b>Propagandist:</b> I have no idea what you're talking about.<br><b>Korra:</b> Oh, I think you do.<br><br><i>(Korra extends one leg upward, and brings it crashing down in a Earthbending kick. The ground beneath the Equalists' table pops up, launching the table out of sight, sending the Propagandist tumbling backwards, sending the other Equalist man crawling away, and scattering the flyers that he was giving out.<br><br>The Propagandist crawls around, trying to pick up as many of the papers as he can. Mako catches one and examines it. There's a picture of Amon on it with his arm outstretched and rays of light emanating from his palm.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Witness the revelation, tonight, nine o'clock. What's the revelation?<br><b>Propagandist:</b> Nothing that concerns the likes of you two!<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(grabs the Propagandist by his jacket and lifts him up with one arm)</i> You better believe it concerns us. Spill it.<br><b>Propagandist:</b> No one knows what the revelation is. And I have no idea what happened to your friend. But if he's a bender then my bet is he's getting what's coming to him.<br><b>Mako:</b> Where's it happening?<br><br><i>(The sound of a shrill whistle is heard. The view shifts to show a stocky police officer standing on the other side of the fountain.)</i><br><br><b>Police:</b> Hey! What's going on over there?<br><b>Propagandist:</b> The Avatar is oppressing us! Help!<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(throws Propagandist off screen)</i> Let's scram.<br><br><i>(As they run away, Mako leans down to grab more of the flyers. He catches up to Korra, who is already on Naga, and as soon as he's in the saddle, too, the group takes off.)</i><br><br><i>(The scene changes to the Republic Streets. A train passes on an overhead rail. Mako and Korra are seated on a bench beneath the rail, looking at the flyers they brought with them. A public map of Republic City is hung up on the wall beside them.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Why didn't the Equalists put a location on these?<br><b>Mako:</b> Probably 'cause they don't want just anyone walking in on their big revelation, whatever that is. I bet the information is hidden on here somehow. Look at the backs. <i>(He Leans over a bunch of the flyers lying randomly on the street in front of him. Some are upside down, showing strange markings in two shades of green.)</i> There's four different images. <i>(Mako picks up two of them, holds them next to each other, and sees that the lines of the design connect. There's a prominent red dot on one of the images.)</i><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(smiling)</i> So, it's a puzzle?<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(smiling and excited)</i> Yeah, of a map! <i>(Mako stands up and takes four of the flyers, arranged to make a full picture, over to the city map on the wall, and holds them up looking for a match.)</i> Bingo! That must be where it's going down.<br><br><i>(Mako looks over to Korra, who smirks fiercely. Cut to commercial break.)</i><br><br><br><br><u><b>Act III</b></u><br><br><i>(It is night once again in Republic City, in a factory neighborhood festooned with empty smokestacks. Many people are moving towards one particular building set a ways apart from the others. Mako and Korra, each wearing a disguising longcoat, observe at a long distance from around the corner of another structure.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> This is the place.<br><br><i>(The both put on hats to complete their disguises and start towards the building. Korra appears to be wearing Mako's red scarf.<br><br>A big-boned bouncer is checking people one-by-one at the door to the Equalist rally. They each show him a paper before they are allowed in.<br><br>As Korra and Mako get closer, she grabs his arm and leans into him.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(confused, whispering)</i> What are you doing?<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(whispering)</i> We'll attract less attention this way.<br><b>Doorman:</b> <i>(crossing his arms over his chest and Korra and Mako approach)</i> This is a private event. No one gets in without an invitation.<br><b>Korra:</b> Uh, invitation?<br><br><i>(The Doorman raised an eyebrow, waiting.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> You mean, this?<br><br><i>(Mako produces one of the map-flyers from his pocket, and holds it up for the Doorman's scrutiny. The Doorman takes and examines it, before turning back to Korra and Mako with a lightened expression.)</i><br><br><b>Doorman:</b> The revelation is upon us, my brother and sister. <i>(motions them through the door)</i><br><br><i>(Korra and Mako enter the building. It is mostly dark, and rusty industrial equipment takes up much of the initial space. However, as the infiltrators move deeper into the building, they emerge on a catwalk and look out over the railing.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> I knew a lot of people hated benders but I've never seen so many in one place. <i>(The camera pans up to reveal a wide-open area where a large audience is forming in front a stage. The stage's backdrop sports a large-sized reproduction of the Amon art from the flyer.)</i> Keep your eyes out for Bolin.<br><br><i>(They make their way down and into the thick of the crowd just as the spotlights start shining on the stage.)</i><br><br><b>Announcer:</b> Please welcome, your hero, your savior, Amon!<br><br><i>(A section of the floor slides open, and from the glaring light below, a platform elevator raises. Equalist chi-blockers are lined up at regular intervals across it. Amon stands in the center, while the Lieutenant is among the chi-blockers, standing directly to Amon's right. The crowd cheers wildly.<br><br>Amon raises his head, letting the light spill down on his mask. The view cuts to Korra, who is still, but her eyes waver in the reflected light. Amon steps forward to where a microphone has emerged from a stand in the stage floor. He pauses to let the crowd continue cheering before holding out a hand and speaking.)</i><br><br><b>Amon:</b> My quest for equality began many years ago. <i>(Takes the microphone off the stand, causing a brief moment of feedback.)</i> When I was a boy, my family and I lived on a small farm. We weren't rich and none of us were benders. This made us very easy targets for the Firebender who extorted my father. <i>(Starts walking across the stage.)</i> One day, my father confronted this man. But when he did, that Firebender took my family from me. Then, he took my face. <i>(Amon turns to face the crowd, and their sympathetic sounds answer him.)</i> I've been forced to hide behind a mask ever since. <i>(The view shifts briefly to show Korra and Mako exchange glances, before returning to Amon.)</i> As you know, the Avatar has recently arrived in Republic City.<br><b>Crowd:</b> Boo!<br><br><i>(In response to the crowd's hostility, Korra tugs the scarf over her face, and Mako leans toward her while looking around warily.)</i><br><br><b>Amon:</b> And if she was here she would tell you that bending brings balance to the world. But she is wrong. The only thing bending has brought to the world is suffering. <i>(Pointing at the crowd.)</i> It has been the cause of every war in every era. <i>(The view shifts to Korra and stays with her, showing her shaking with an angry expression.)</i> But that is about to change. <i>(Korra looks confused, then the view shifts back to Amon looking out over the crowd.)</i> I know you've been wondering, 'what is the revelation?' You are about to get your answer. <i>(A brief look at Korra and Mako shows them exchange another set of worried glances.)</i> Since the beginning of time, the spirits have acted as guardians of our world and they have spoken to me. They say the Avatar has failed humanity. <i>(Korra is shown getting angry again. Back on the stage, Amon puts a hand to his heart.)</i> That is why the spirits have chosen me to usher in a new era of balance. They have granted me a power that will make equality a reality. The power to take a person's bending away, permanently.<br><br><i>(The camera closes in tight on Korra, whose eyes go wide with shock.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> That's impossible. <i>(turns to Mako)</i> There's no way.<br><b>Mako:</b> This guy is insane.<br><b>Amon:</b> Now, for a demonstration. <i>(Amon motions to the back of the stage, where the Lieutenant is bringing out a line of men with their hands tied behind their backs.)</i> Please welcome Lightening Bolt Zolt, leader of the Triple Threat Triad, and one of the most notorious criminals in Republic City.<br><br><i>(Zolt is brought up to stand beside Among himself.)</i><br><br><b>Crowd:</b> Boo!<br><b>Zolt:</b> <i>(angry)</i> Ah, boo yourself!<br><br><i>(The other captives are being herded by the chi-blockers along the back of the stage and forced to their knees. Among them is Shady Shin, but the view zooms in on the last in the line-up, Bolin, who's looking around with obvious fear.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> There's Bolin.<br><br><i>(Korra starts forward as if to rescue him right there, but Mako grabs her shoulder and pulls her back.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Wait! We can't fight them all. We need to be smart about this.<br><b>Korra:</b> Then come up with a game plan, <i>(harsher)</i> team captain.<br><b>Amon:</b> Zolt has amassed a fortune by extorting and abusing non-benders. But his reign of terror is about to come to an end. <i>(The Lieutenant unties Zolt's hands.)</i> Now in the interest of fairness I will give Zolt the chance to fight to keep his bending.<br><br><i>(Zolt is shoved to the opposite side of the stage from Amon, but he immediately turns to face his challenger.)</i><br><br><b>Zolt:</b> <i>(smug)</i> You're gonna regret doing that, pal.<br><br><i>(Zolt immediately throws a series of fireballs straight at Amon, who dodges them with sidestepping leaps that gradually carry him forward. Zolt moves his hands together and summons lightning, which he shoots at Amon with a leaping thrust. Amon once again side-leaps the attack and, finally reaching Zolt, grabs his lightning-spewing arm and moves it down in a wide arc. Lightning shoots wildly, scorching the stage before moving up to play along the stage's scaffolding and spotlights.<br><br>Then, Amon jabs a finger in the back of Zolt's neck, causing the gangster to gasp. Amon raises his other hand, and brings it down smoothly on Zolt's head. Amon's thumb pokes down on Zolt's forehead, while his next two fingers poke across at the side of Zolt's head, just before the ear. Zolt's eyes go wide, and his irises shrink.<br><br>As Korra and Mako watch, Zolt's lightning shrinks to fizzle harmlessly in the air, then turns into plain Firebending, which in turn extinguishes completely. Amon lets go of Zolt, and the gangster flops down to the floor of the stage. Amon waits patiently while his opponent pushes himself back up. Zolt tries to punch a fireball at Amon, but no flame appears and he loses his balance and topples weakly forward to slam back to the stage floor.)</i><br><br><b>Zolt:</b> <i>(scared)</i> What, what did you do to me?<br><b>Amon:</b> Your Firebending is gone. Forever.<br><br><i>(The crowd gasps. Korra stares up at the stage in slack-jawed shock.)</i><br><br><b>Amon:</b> The era of bending is over. A new era of equality has begun.<br><br><i>(Amon raises a fist, and the crowd breaks into cheers and applause. One of the chi-blockers on the stages pulls Shady Shin to his feet, unties him, and kicks him forward.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(turning to Mako)</i> Any ideas yet?<br><b>Mako:</b> I think so. See those machines? <i>(Mako looks over to a series of pipes set against the wall, surrounding a pair of large canisters.)</i> They're powered by water and steam. If you can create some cover I can grab Bolin without anyone seeing, then, we duck outta here.<br><b>Korra:</b> Works for me. <i>(As Mako starts to move, Korra holds him in place by the shoulder.)</i> Mako, good luck. <i>(She holds up a hand to him.)</i><br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(clasping her hand)</i> You too.<br><br><i>(They escape the crowd and separate. Korra looks around to make sure no one is watching, and heads into a hallway behind a large piece of machinery. She finds a boiler, and turns one of the valves with some effort. A gust of steam shoots out of a nearby pipe.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> No, that's not enough.<br><br><i>(She crouches down to try another valve, setting off another small jet of steam.)</i><br><br><b>Doorman:</b> Hey you.<br><br><i>(The Doorman approaches from the far end of the hallway. Korra stands up in response.<br><br>Meanwhile, Mako is forcing his way to the front of the crowd. On stage, Amon has Shady Shin in the same grasp that he used to take away Zolt's bending. Shin is gasping and shaking. The last of the Triad captives looks at Bolin with evident fear, then is hauled to his feet by a chi-blocker.<br><br>In the boiler room, Korra and the Doorman are looking at each other.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Is there a problem, my brother?<br><b>Doorman:</b> What are you doing back here?<br><b>Korra:</b> Uhh, looking for the bathroom.<br><br><i>(Korra smiles hopefully, but the Doorman takes a wrench out of a pocket. Korra's eyes narrow as she prepares to defend, and the Doorman twirls the improvised weapon in his fingers before swinging it hard at Korra. She sidesteps and ducks under his attacks, and the last blow of the wrench lands on something metal as the scene cuts back to the stage. Amon is taking the bending of another Triad thug, while Mako looks around anxiously.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Come on...<br><br><i>(Back in the boiler room, Korra dodges another swing of the wrench, and pulls Mako's scarf off her neck. She whips it into the air, and when the wrench comes down again, she twists the scarf so that it wraps around the Doorman's arm. Korra pulls the scarf so that the Doorman swings away from her, then she pulls him back towards the boiler and snaps the scarf free so that the Doorman goes flying into the boiler machinery. His impact breaks open a series of pipes, flooding the corridor with steam.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Thanks. This should be enough.<br><br><i>(Back on the stage, a chi-blocker unties a terrified Bolin and shoves him to his feet. Bolin stumbles out into the center of the stage, and winds up facing Amon, who is letting go of the last Triad thug. As the crowd cheers, Amon turns to face Bolin.</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(tapping fingers together nervously)</i> Uhh, hello, Amon, sir. I think there's been a big misunderstanding.<br><br><i>(Back in the boiler room, the entire scene is obscured by steam, and Korra is bending it out with full-arm Bending motions. She thrusts her palm forward for an especially strong burst of Bending, and the scene cuts back to Bolin on the stage, where an explosion opposite the stage startles everyone and sends steam pouring out over everything while the crowd screams and runs. Amon simply looks at everything, then turns and walks back into the obscuring fog.<br><br>Bolin is looking around when a chi-blocker comes out of the steam and grabs him from behind. Mako, in turn, pops out of the steam behind the chi-blocker and grabs the masked Equalist by the arm. He flips the chi-blocker straight off the stage.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Bolin! You alright?<br><b>Bolin:</b> Yes! <i>(claps hands together)</i> Mako! I love you!<br><br><i>(Bolin holds his arms out for a hug, but Mako simply hooks his brother in one arm and drags him back into the fog.<br><br>The scene cuts to an exterior balcony on the building, where a door opens up spewing steam and the escaping brothers. They make immediately for a ladder on the far side of the balcony and start climbing down. While they're still descending, the Lieutenant comes out of the open door, and finds them on the ladder. Mako looks up to see the Equalist take out a pair of metal truncheons and spin them in his hands so that they're pointing down at the ladder. The Lieutenant presses the clubs against the top rung, and they release a visible burst of electricity that shocks both brothers. They let go and fall off the ladder into a wide alley. The Lieutenant leaps down after them, striking with his shock batons again as he lands. The brothers flip out of the way, and take Probending stances.<br><br>Mako punches a burst of fire, but the Lieutenant dodges and rushes in at the Firebender. He swings his truncheons in at Mako, who attempts to sidestep but is still hit and knocked to the ground. Bolin does a full front-flip that shoots over a heavy disk of earth, but the Lieutenant jumps over it. Bolin tries again with the same results, and so panics and raises an earth wall to protect himself from the approaching Equalist. The Lieutenant does a leaping handstand straight over the wall, and delivers a flurry of electric baton strikes. Bolin is backed against his own wall, and the Lieutenant makes him scream and knocks him unconscious with a double-thrust of the electric weapons.<br><br>Mako comes from around the wall with a fiery jump kick, but the Lieutenant blocks the flame with his batons. Mako kicks again, but the flames only knock Bolin's wall down, as the Lieutenant flips in a circle around his attacker. The two men exchange a series of blows, electricity versus fire, but the Lieutenant gets an opening and stabs a baton forward against Mako's chest. Mako screams and goes down.)</i><br><br><b>Lieutenant:</b> You benders need to understand there's no place for you in the world anymore.<br><br><i>(Abruptly, the ground beneath the Lieutenant erupts into a slanted slab of Earthbending, flinging him hard against the alley wall. He crashes heavily to the ground, but weakly pushes himself up to see Korra in a Bending stance, backlit with golden light.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> I wouldn't count us out just yet. <i>(The Lieutenant falls back to the ground, and Korra whistles towards the alley entrance.)</i> Naga!<br><br><i>(Naga comes running down a set of stairs at the far end of the alley. Korra helps Mako to his feet, and as Equalist chi-blockers comes streaming out of the door that the brothers had escaped from earlier, the two Benders mount Naga. Bolin comes to and looks around wearily, then screams in panic as Naga runs straight over him and grabs his shirt in her jaws. As the dog runs, Bolin is bounced up and down uncomfortably.</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Ah. Stop. I want. To be. On. Your back.<br><b>Lieutenant:</b> <i>(pointing at the escaping Naga)</i> The Avatar. That's her!<br><br><i>(The chi-blockers start running after Naga, but the camera pulls back to reveal Amon standing on the balcony above with his hands clasped behind his back.)</i><br><br><b>Amon:</b> Let her go. <i>(raising his arms to lean on the railing)</i> She's the perfect messenger to tell the city of my power.<br><br><i>(The scene changes to a shot of the full moon, and pans down to reveal Air Temple Island. Tenzin is talking with a pair of White Lotus guards on a roofed walkway when he sees Korra approaching by herself. Tenzin hurries over to her and puts his arms on her shoulders.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Thank goodness. I was just about to send out a search party. Are you alright?<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(turning away and crossing her arms)</i> Nun-uh.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> Korra. What happened? Did you find your friend?<br><b>Korra:</b> Yes, but. I was at an Equalist rally. I saw Amon.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(surprised)</i> What?<br><b>Korra:</b> He can take people's bending away. For good.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> That's... <i>(eyes shifting briefly to the side)</i> That's impossible. Only the Avatar has ever possessed that ability.<br><b>Korra:</b> But I saw him do it.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(quietly)</i> I believe you. I don't know how Amon has achieved this power. But this means the revolution is more dangerous than ever. No bender is safe.<br><br><i>(The view pans up over Korra and Tenzin to focus on the distant Republic City, its lights shining brightly in the night.)</i><br><br><br><br>[End Credits]<br>

After coming face to face with Amon, leader of the Equalists, Avatar Korra discovers a terrifying truth: This masked madman has the ability to take away a person's bending, permanently! Benders of Republic City are counting on their young Avatar but is she prepared to face such a frightening foe?<br><br><br><br><b><u>Act I</b></u><br><br><i>(The episode opens with a shot of the moon shining brightly in a cloudy night sky. The camera zooms out and rotates until the open window of Korra's room comes into view, the shutters swaying in the breeze. Korra is asleep in bed. Cut to a shot of a shoji wall as light shines through the paper. Someone's shadow quickly darts across the paper doors. Korra wakes up with a start just before an Equalist chi blocker jumps in through the window. breaking the shutters. Korra looks startled, and two more chi blockers burst through the shoji doors. Korra leaps up and performs two spinning firebending kicks, which the chi blockers dodge. Korra follows up with two firebending punches, but misses as the chi blockers surround her. One jumps at Korra and kicks, but Korra blocks and counters with a barrage of fire punches. Another chi blocker closes in on Korra and executes a series of quick strikes up along her spine. Korra gives a yell and falls to her knees. Footsteps are heard approaching, and Korra looks up to see Amon standing above her)</i><br><br><b>Amon:</b> After I take your bending away you will be nothing. <br><br><i>(Amon reaches out towards Korra's face, her eyes wide with terror. The scene quickly fades to black, then cuts to Korra waking up from her nightmare with a scream, back in her room. She pants hard and beads of sweat are on her face. Korra looks to her right to see Naga licking her hand and laying her head on Korra's lap to comfort her. She strokes Naga's head.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> It's alright, Naga. I just had a bad dream.<br><br><i>(Korra lays her head on top of Naga's, and the scene cuts to an exterior shot of City Hall. The camera zooms in slowly.)</i><br><br><b>Tarrlok:</b> <i>(off camera)</i> There is a madman running around our beloved city, <i>(cut to the interior of City Hall where the five representatives, including Tenzin, are seated around the table.)</i> threatening to tear it apart. We need to create a task force whose sole mission is to find Amon and bring him to justice. <br><b>Tenzin:</b> Absolutely not. A move that aggressive would only further divide benders and non-benders. <br><b>Fire Nation Councilwoman:</b> Tarrlok, I'm inclined to agree with your proposal, but, who would even head up such a task force? <br><b>Tarrlok:</b>  <i>(stands up and bows)</i> It would be my honor and privilege to accept such a duty.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> This is just another one of your ploys to gain more power, <i>(thumps fist on table)</i> isn't it? <br><b>Tarrlok:</b> All I'm trying to do is help. Think back, forty-two years ago Republic City was threatened by another dangerous man: Yakone. Your father wasn't afraid to deal with him head on. <br><b>Tenzin:</b> This is a completely different situation <i>(points at Tarrlok and raises his voice)</i> and how dare you compare yourself to Avatar Aang!<br><b>Tarrlok:</b> Amon is not going to stop with the bending triads.

Tarlokk looks up at Tenzin and smirks, while Tenzin glares back at him. The sound of jazz music over the radio begins to play, and the scene cuts to an exterior shot of Tenzin's home on Airbender Island at night, with the full moon shining brightly. The camera tilts down to show Korra practicing her airbending moves while listening to a radio placed on a railing. Cut to a closer shot of Korra, and the radio begins to put out static for a second before Amon's voice is heard. Korra looks back in surprise.)</i><br><br><b>Amon:</b> <i>(through the radio)</i> My fellow Equalists, <i>(cut to a shot of the radio, zooming in slowly)</i> this is your leader, Amon. <i>(cut to a closer shot of Korra turning around, looking nervous)</i> As you have heard, the Republic council has voted to make me public enemy number one, <i>(cut back to the radio, zoomed in closer)</i> proving once again that the bending oppressors of this city will stop at nothing to quash our revolution. <i>(cut to a close up of Korra, then to a close up of the radio)</i> But we can not be stopped. Our numbers grow stronger by the day. <i>(cut to an extreme close up of Korra's eyes, looking frightened and with beads of sweat dripping down her skin)</i> You no longer have to live in fear. The time has come for benders to experience fear. <br><br><i>(Cut to a bird's-eye-view of Korra and the radio, and zoom out before cutting to an exterior shot of a factory at day time.

I didn't see you! <br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(sitting up and rubbing his head)</i> How could you not see me? I mean I was ju-juss-- <i>(becomes lovestruck and blushes when Asami takes off her helmet and goggles, revealing her beautiful face as she flings her hair to the side)</i> I was, I, I. Wow. I was, ahem. <br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(reaching down to help Mako up)</i> Are you okay? Did I hurt you? I am such an idiot. <br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(brushing himself off)</i> Don't worry, I'm fine. My brother hits me harder than that every day in practice. <br><b>Asami:</b> Wait, I recognize you. You're Mako, right? You play for the Fire Ferrets. <br><b>Mako:</b> Yeah, that's me. <br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(covers her face and blushes)</i> I am so embarrassed. <i>(offers her hand to Mako and they shake)</i> My name's Asami.

I don't have any clothes nice enough for a place that classy. <br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(putting her helmet and goggles back on s she walks to her Moped)</i> I'll take care of that. All you need to do is show up. So, it's a date? <br><b>Mako:</b> Uh, yeah. I guess so. I'll see you tomorrow night. <br><br><i>(Cut to a closeup of Asami's hand as she revs up her Moped. She drives off past Mako, and looks back at him to smile. As she rides away, Mako turns around, grinning and blushing with hearts floating around his head. The scene cuts to a shot of Airbender Island as the sun sets behind it. Cut to the dining room as Korra, Tenzin, and his family sit around the table with their dinner.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> We are grateful for this delicious food, for happiness, for compassion, and--<br><b>Tarrlok:</b> <i>(off camera)</i> I'm not interrupting, am I?<br><br><i>(Tenzin looks surprised, and the camera pans to the left as Tenzin looks to the doorway to see Tarrlok standing there and bowing.

We're about to eat dinner. <br><b>Tarrlok:</b> Good because I am absolutely famished. Airbenders never turn away a hungry guest, am I right? <br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(Sigh.)</i> I suppose.<br><br><i>(Tenzin sits back down. Pema frowns at him and Tenzin shrugs in response.)</i> <br><br><b>Tarrlok:</b> <i>(approaching Korra)</i> Ahh, you must be the famous Avatar Korra. It is truly an honor. I am Councilman Tarrlok, representative from the Northern Water Tribe. <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(standing and bowing)</i> Nice to meet you.<br><br><i>(Korra sits back down and Tarrlok sits down next to Korra. Ikki scoots close to Tarrlok.)</i><br><br><b>Ikki:</b> Why do you have three pony-tails? <i>(sniffs)</i> And how come you smell like a lady? You're weird.<br><b>Tarrlok:</b> Well aren't you... precocious. So, I've been reading all about your adventures in the papers. Infiltrating Amon's rally, now that took some real initiative. <br><b>Korra:</b> Oh, thanks. I think you're the first authority figure in the city who's happy I'm here. <br><b>Tarrlok:</b> Republic City is much better off now that you've arrived. <br><b>Tenzin:</b> Enough with the flattering, Tarrlok. What do you want from Korra? <br><b>Tarrlok:</b> Patience, Tenzin. I'm getting to that. As you may have heard, I am assembling a task force that will strike at the heart of the revolution and I want you to join me. <br><b>Korra:</b> Really?<br><b>Tenzin:</b> What?<br><b>Tarrlok:</b> I need someone who will help me attack Amon directly, someone who is fearless in the face of danger, and that someone is you. <br><b>Korra:</b> Join your task force? I can't.<br><br><i>(The camera zooms in on Tarrlok, looking surprised. Cut to Tenzin looking surprised as well. Cut to a close up of Korra and zoom in as she calmly drinks from her cup. Cut to black.)</i><br><br><br><br><b><u>Act II</b></u><br><br><i>(Fade in to an overhead shot of the dinner table. Korra is eating calmly.)</i><br><br><b>Tarrlok:</b> I must admit, I'm rather surprised. I thought you'd jump at the chance to help me lead the charge against Amon. <br><b>Tenzin:</b> Me too.<br><b>Korra:</b> I came to Republic City to finish my Avatar training with Tenzin. Right now I just need to focus on that. <br><b>Tarrlok:</b> Which is why this opportunity is perfect. You would get on the job experience while performing your Avatar duty for the city. <br><b>Tenzin:</b> Korra gave you her answer. It's time for you to go. <br><b>Tarrlok:</b> <i>(standing up)</i> Very well. But, I'm not giving up on you just yet. You'll be hearing from me soon. It has been a pleasure, Avatar Korra.<br><br><i>(Tarrlok begins to leave the room, and Ikki stands up to wave goodbye.)</i><br><br><b>Ikki:</b> Bye-bye, Pony-tail Man!<br><b>Tarrlok:</b> Hmph.<br><br><i>(Cut to an establishing shot of Kuang's restaurant, brightly lit up at night as a trolley passes by. Mako is stranding in front of it. Cut to a high angle shot of Mako looking up in awe of the establishment. He grabs the end of his scarf, then looks at the rest of his clothes, noting their poor condition. He sighs and walks inside. Cut to a close up of the butler.)</i><br><br><b>Butler:</b> <i>(gesturing widely and bowing down to the floor)</i> Ah, welcome to Kuang's Cuisine, Master Mako.<br><b>Mako:</b> Uh, master?<br><br><i>(The shot transitions to a shot of Mako and the butler in a room. Mako has his coat off as the butler pulls a clean shirt out from a box on the table. The camera position stays the same as a series of jump cuts show the butler dressing Mako in cleaner, more formal clothes and styling his hair. The shot transitions again to Mako's legs, and the camera tilts up to show off his new look, along with a sparkling sound effect. Mako takes a moment to admire himself before draping his scarf around his shoulders. The butler examines Mako for a second before reaching to take the scarf. Mako grabs his arm to stop him.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(sternly)</i> The scarf stays. <br><b>Butler:</b> <i>(backing off and bowing to the floor)</i> As you wish, sir. This way please.<br><br><i>(Mako follows the butler out. Cut to a shot of the dining area of the restaurant, with people seated at a table and being served. The camera pans to the left and zooms in on Mako and Asami sitting next to each other with drinks. Asami is now wearing a more formal dress.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> I am such a big pro-bending fan. I caught all of your matches this season. <br><b>Mako:</b> All of them? Wow. Honestly, there were a few I wish you hadn't seen. <br><b>Asami:</b> Oh don't be ridiculous. You're amazing! I can't wait to see you play in the tournament. <br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(hesitantly)</i> Yeah, well. Uhh. Maybe next year.<br><b>Asami:</b> What do you mean? You made it in.<br><b>Mako:</b> It just isn't in the cards for us right now. <br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(placing her hand on Mako's)</i> Tell me. What's the problem?<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(sighs)</i> We don't have the cash to ani-up for the championship pot. So, it looks like we're out of the running. <br><b>Asami:</b> That's not fair. <br><br><i>(The server arrives with two silver platters.)</i><br><br><b>Server:</b> Pardon me, Miss Sato. Your main course.<br><br><i>(The server takes the covers off the platters and leaves.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Miss Sato? You wouldn't happen to be related to Hiroshi Sato, creator of the Satomobile?<br><b>Asami:</b> Yeah, he's my dad.<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(amazed)</i> Get outta town!<br><b>Asami:</b> I'm serious! You want to meet him?<br><b>Mako:</b> Meet the most successful captain of industry in all of Republic City? Yeah, I'll take you up on that. <br><br><i>(Cut to the courtyard of Airbender Island at sunset. The camera tilts down to show Korra sitting on a stoop, with Naga laying next to her on her back.

Hello fellow teammate! <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(rubbing Naga's belly)</i> Hey, Bolin. <br><b>Bolin:</b> Missed you at practice this week. <br><b>Korra:</b> Yeah, sorry about that. <br><b>Bolin:</b> Aww, that's alright. We're probably out of the tournament anyway unless some money miraculously drops out of the sky by tomorrow. Anyway, the reason I came by was to give you this. Ta-da!<br><br><i>(Bolin presents Korra with a rose and a cupcake with cherries on top. Pabu chirps and jumps off of Bolin.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(taking the gifts)</i> Wow, thanks. What's this for?<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(sarcastically)</i> Uhh, I can't remember now. Oh, yeah, now I remember! You saved me from Amon.<br><b>Korra:</b> Oh, that? It was no big deal.<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(getting excited)</i> No big deal, are you serious? I was totally freaking out when he was coming at me with his creepy mask all, <i>(imitating Amon and acting mock frightening.)</i> "I will take away your bending forever!" <i>(cut to a close up of Korra and zoom in as she looks worried)</i> I mean that is scary stuff! I still can't sleep well. <br><b>Korra:</b> Mm-hmm.<br><b>Council Page:</b> <i>(off camera)</i> Delivery for Avatar Korra! <i>(cut to a shot of the page approaching with a large box of flowers and gifts and placing it by the stoop)</i> Tarrlok sends his compliments and urges you to reconsider his offer. <br><b>Korra:</b> Tell him I haven't changed my mind.<br><b>Council Page:</b> Mmm-hmm. <br><br><i>(The page bows and leaves.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(angry)</i> Who's this "Tarrlok" guy? Is he bothering you? Huh? 'Cause I can have a word with him.<br><b>Korra:</b> Ha! No, it's not like that. He's just some old guy who works with Tenzin on the council. <br><b>Bolin:</b> Oh! Good. Good, that sounds better. I like that better. <br><br><i>(The scene cuts to the interior of Sato's factory as a satomobile is assembled. The camera pans right to show Hiroshi Sato, Asami, and Mako on the factory floor between lines of satomobiles on conveyor belts.)</i><br><br><b>Hiroshi Sato:</b> What do you think of my little operation here? <br><b>Mako:</b> It's very impressive, Mr. Sato. <br><b>Hiroshi:</b> Please, call me Hiroshi. So, I understand you're dirt poor.<br><b>Mako:</b> Uh... Well.<br><b>Hiroshi:</b> Young man, it is nothing to be ashamed of. I too came from humble beginnings. Why, when I was your age I was a mere shoe shiner and all I had to my name was an idea: the Satomobile. <i>(cut to a close up of the hood ornament of a satomobile, then zoom out and pan around the staomobile)</i> Now I was fortunate enough to meet someone who believed in me and my work ethic. He gave me the money I needed to get my idea off the ground. <i>(the camera tilts up to show the rest of the factory as Hiroshi gestures to all of it)</i> And I built the entire Future Industries Empire from that one, self-less loan. <br><b>Asami:</b> Dad, stop bragging! Just tell Mako the good news!<br><b>Hiroshi:</b> Heh heh heh heh heh.<br><b>Mako:</b> What good news?<br><b>Hiroshi:</b> <i>(placing a hand of Mako's shoulder)</i> Well my daughter passionately told me all about your hard earned success in the Pro-Bending arena and about your team's current financial stumbling block. Now I hate to see you loose your chance at winning the championship just because you're short a few yuans. That's why I'm going to sponsor the Fire Ferrets in the tournament!<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(shocked)</i> Are you serious!?<br><b>Asami:</b> He's serious! My dad's going to cover your ani for the championship pot.<br><b>Mako:</b> That, that is good news! <br><b>Hiroshi:</b> There's just one catch. You all have to wear the Future Industries' logo on your uniforms.<br><b>Mako:</b> I'll tattoo it on my chest if you want, Sir. <i>(Asami and Hiroshi both chuckle. Mako shakes hands with them)</i> Thank you both so much. I promise the Fire Ferrets will make the most of this opportunity. <br><br><i>(The scene cuts to Tenzin on Airbender Island approaching a maroon convertible satomobile with a large pink ribbon tied around it, preseumably another gift from Tarrlok to Korra. Ikki and Meelo are sitting in it and pretending to drive.)</i><br><br><b>Ikki:</b> Outta the way, Daddy! We're driving here! Beeeeeep! Beep beep beep!<br><br><i>(Tenzin shakes his head in disappointment at Tarrlok's efforts.)</i><br><br><b>Meelo:</b> <i>(quietly)</i> Beep beep!<br><br><i>(Tenzin walks past and we cut to Korra practicing her airbending movements in the octogonal training area. Tenzin walks into frame.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> I see Tarrlok's gifts are getting more and more extravagant. <br><b>Korra:</b> Yeah. That guy doesn't know how to take "no" for an answer.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> Korra, are you doing alright? <br><b>Korra:</b> Yeah, I'm fine. <br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(sitting on the steps and offering Korra to sit next to him)</i> Why don't you take a break? I'm glad you turned down Tarrlok but I just wanted to make sure your decision was for the right reason. <br><br><i>(Korra walks over to Tenzin and sits beside him.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> I'm just really focused on my airbending right now, is all. <br><b>Tenzin:</b> Right. That's what you said. You know, it's okay to be scared. The whole city is frightened by what's been going on. The important thing is to talk about our fears because if we don't, they can throw us out of balance. <i>(Korra looks to Tenzin a moment, then looks away. Tenzin stands up to leave)</i> I'm always here for you if you want to talk. <br><br><i>(The scene fades to a close up of Korra looking sad as she lounges on a railing in the evening. The voice of the council page catches her attention.)</i><br><br><b>Council Page:</b> Avatar Korra, I have something for you.<br><br><i>(The council page approaches as Ikki and Jinora are playing Pai Sho on a table below. Korra hops down to the ground to confront the page.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> It doesn't matter how many gifts Tarrlok sends, I'm not joining his task force! <br><br><i>(Korra uses earthbending to turn the page around, then kicks him in the butt to get him away.)</i><br><br><b>Council Page:</b> It's not a gift! It's an invitation.<br><b>Korra:</b> To what?<br><b>Council Page:</b> <i>(pulling out an invitation card)</i> Tarrlok is throwing a gala in your honor. All of Republic City's movers and shakers will be there. The councilman humbly requests your attendance. <br><br><i>(Korra takes the card and looks at it suspiciously. Background music begins to play, and then the scene cuts to an establishing shot in the evening of the building the gala is being held at. The camera tilts down to show large banners of Korra hanging on either side of the entrnce. Cut to a shot of Korra, Tenzin, nd Pema entering, dressed in formal wear as Ikki, Meelo, and Jinora run out ahead of them. Cut to an overhead shot of the partygoers clapping at Korra's arrival. Tenzin stays by Korra's side while Pema talks to someone in the crowd.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> I can't believe this is all for me. <br><b>Tenzin:</b> I'm not sure what Tarrlok's plotting but keep your guard up. It's not like him just to throw a party for the fun of it. <br><br><i>(Tarrlok approaches the two of them from within the crowd.)</i><br><br><b>Tarrlok:</b> So glad you could make it, Avatar Korra. If you'll excuse us, the city awaits it's hero. <br><br><i>(Tarrlok gestures for Korra to follow him while Meelo runs past. Tenzin watches them go, and turns his head to see Meelo doing something off screen which fills him with comedic dread.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Meelo, no! That is not a toilet! Oh, dear.<br><br><i>(Cut to Korra and Tarrlok, with Hiroshi Sato in the foreground.)</i><br><br><b>Tarrlok:</b> Korra, it is my pleasure to introduce Republic City's most famous industrialist, Hiroshi Sato.<br><b>Korra:</b> Nice to meet you.<br><b>Hiroshi:</b> <i>(bows)</i> We're all expecting great things from you. <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(meekly)</i> Right. Greatness. <br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(off screen)</i> Hey, Korra! <br><br><i>(Korra looks up and pouts as Mako, Asami, and Bolin approach. Asami has her arm around Mako's.)</i><br><br><b>Hiroshi:</b> This is my daughter, Asami.<br><b>Asami:</b> It's lovely to meet you. Mako told me so much about you. <br><b>Korra:</b> Really, because he hasn't mentioned you at all. How did you two meet?<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(rushing in next to Korra)</i> Asami crashed into him on her Moped. <i>(rushes off screen)</i><br><b>Korra:</b> What? Are you okay? <br><b>Mako:</b> I'm fine. More than fine. Mr. Sato agreed to sponsor our team. We're back in the tournament. <br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(putting an arm around Mako's shoulder)</i> Isn't that great?!<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(meekly)</i> Yeah, terrific. <br><br><i>(Korra looks off to the side. Chief Beifong walks by and Tarrlok gestures to her to come over.)</i><br><br><b>Tarrlok:</b> Chief Beifong! I believe you and Avatar Korra have already met. <br><b>Chief Beifong:</b> Just because the city's throwing you this big to-do don't think you're something special. You've done absolutely nothing to deserve this. <br><br><i>(Beifong leaves and Korra glares after her. Cut to a close up of Korra as she looks down glumly from being reminded of the truth. The scene fades to a shot of Korra and Tarrlok walking in from offscreen to the top of a large stairway. The camera quickly zoom out to show several journalists waiting for her at the bottom. They all quickly approach and begin asking questions and taking pictures. Tenzin notices and looks worried.)</i><br><br><b>Journalists:</b> Hello! I've got this! One more question, Miss! I think if we could -- Hold up! Hold up!<br><b>Tarrlok:</b> If you'd be so kind, they just have a couple questions.<br><b>Korra:</b> But--<br><br><i>(Tarrlok moves Korra out in front of him, leaving her to fend for herself against the press.)</i><br><br><b>Journalist:</b> Avatar Korra, you witnessed Amon take away people's bending firsthand. How serious a threat does he pose to the innocent citizens of Republic City?<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(hesitantly)</i> Ahem. I think he presents a real problem. <br><br><i>(Tarrlok looks away and smiles smugly.)</i><br><br><b>Journalist:</b> Than why have you refused to join Tarrlok's task force? As the Avatar, shouldn't you be going after Amon?<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(camera flashes in her eyes)</i> Well, I--<br><b>Journalist:</b> Why are you backing away from this fight?<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(annoyed)</i> What?! No, I've never backed away from anything in my life. <br><b>Journalists:</b> You promised to serve this city. Are you going back on that promise now? Do you think Pro-Bending is more important than fighting the revolution? How do you think Avatar Aang would've handled this? Are you afraid of Amon?<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(angrily)</i> I'm not afraid of anybody! If the city needs me, than, I'll join Tarrlok's task force and help fight Amon.<br><b>Tarrlok:</b> <i>(walks back to Korra and puts his hand on her shoulder)</i> There's your headline, folks.<br><br><i>(The jounralists begin taking more photos. Cut to a close up of Tenzin as he closes his eyes and tilts his head down sadly. Cut to Asami, Bolin, and Mako. Mako and Bolin look to each other worriedly. A camera flash cuts back to Tarrlok smiling smugly with his arm around Korra. Another flash cut to a close up of Korra looking very worried. Cut to black.)</i><br><br><br><br><b><u>Act III</b></u><br><br><i>(Fade in to an establishing shot of city hall at sunset. Cut to a closeup of Korra's hands as she twiddles her thumbs at a table. then tilt up to show Korra looking nervouse and dressed in a task force uniform. Tarrlok begins to speak, and the camera pans around Korra to reveal the rest of the task force members around the table and then stopping on Tarrlok adressing them.)</i><br><br><b>Tarrlok:</b> My fellow task force deputies. Tonight we will execute a raid on an underground chi-blocking training camp located in the Dragon Flats Burroughs. According to my sources there is a cellar under this bookstore where Equalists train chi-blocking in secret.<br><br><i>(As Tarrlok speaks, he points to a blue print of the bookstore with notes written on it. The camera zooms in on the blueprint and the scene match dissolves to an overhead shot of the bookstore at night. A police truck with a large tank of water on it drives up to the building. Cut to a shot of Korra and other task force members crouching in the bed of the truck as it pulls up. It comes to a stop and they all climb out. Tarrlok, Korra, and the task force approach the wall and look down into the basement window. From Korra's point of view we see Equalists wearing bandanas around their faces practicing chi blocking. Korra looks toward the back wall and sees a large banner of Amon hanging there. Cut to a close up of the Amon banner, then flash cut to a shot of Amon reaching out towards the camer from Korra's nightmare. <br><br>Cut to Korra gasping and pulling bck from the window. She looks frightened but steels herself and looks over to Tarrlok. Tarrlok smiles and nods to Korra before giving the signal to the rest of the task force. One of the members turns a valve on top of the water tank and opens it up. He pulls a large stream of water out with his bending and it is passed down to the benders by the wall, each taking a part of it. Tarrlok holds a hand up to make them wait. Korra takes a deep breath as she gets ready and the background music intensifies.<br><br>Cut to the inside of the basement. Everything is silent for a moment before suddenly huge torrents of water burst through the windows above. They knock down four Equalists before freezing them in place. The camera zooms out as the wall is burst open by earthbending, and the other Equalists leap back to avoid the debris. Earthbender task force member leap out from the dust and strike at the Equalists, knocking down two more while others leap to dodge the rocks. An earthbender catches on Equalist by surprise by slamming a large floor tile against her and into the wall. Korra and Tarrlok jump into the fray with water ready. Tarrlok throws water at one Equalist and freezes his head. Another Equalist flips out of the way, and the scene goes into slow motion as he tosses out two smoke grenades pouring out green fumes before running out the door with another Equalist. Korra throws water at the grenades and freezes them to keep them from hiding the Equalists' escape.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> I'm going after those two!<br><br><i>(Cut to the inside of an old hallway in disrepair as Korra slams the door open and runs past the camera. Cut to a low angle shot of Korra approaching, then focus in on a trip wire which Korra stumbles over. She trips and falls to the floor, and the camera quickly tilts up to the rafters as a chi blocker leaps down. Korra is frightened, but rolls and flips out of the way, missing the chi blocker's strikes. As Korra falls backward, she kicks into the air and earthbends a large rock from the floor up into the chi blocker. Korra lands on her butt, and another chi blocker spinning a bolo lands behind her only to be struck with a torrent of water and frozen to the wall. by Tarrlok.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Nice timing.

A photo flash cuts to a closer still shot of Korra and Tarrlok posing behind the tied up chi blockers. Another photo flash cuts to a still shot of Tarrlok, Korra, and the task force leading the Equalists into the back of a police truck. One more photo flash cuts to a shot of the task force and chi blockers surrounded by journalists. Tarrlok is smiling smuggly while Korra is at the front and looking determined. The color becomes desaturated as the shot transitions to a picture in a newspaper which pulls away from the camera. Bolin walks by carrying two earth discs with his earthbending. The camera cuts to a wider shot of the training room at the Pro Bending arena. Mako is sitting down on a spring board with the newspaper and Toza is sweeping the floor.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> No Korra for practice again?<br><b>Mako:</b> Doesn't look like it. <br><br><i>(Bolin tosses his discs away and pouts comically, hunching his back. The scene cuts to Tarrlok and Korra at a press conference set indoors adressing a large group of journalists seated in front of them. Tarrlok is at the podium.)</i><br><br><b>Tarrlok:</b> Avatar Korra has bravely answered the call to action. With the two of us leading the charge, Republic City has nothing to fear from Amon and the Equalists.<br><b>Journalist:</b> Question for the Avatar! Amon remains at large. Why have you failed to locate him?<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(approaching the podium)</i> You wanna know why? Because Amon is hiding in the shadows like a coward. <i>(grabs a microphone)</i> Amon, I challenge you to a duel. No task force. No chi blockers. Just the two of us tonight at midnight on Avatar Aang Memorial Island. Let's cut to the chase and settle this thing. If you're man enough to face me. <br><br><i>(All is quiet save for some feedback from the microphone as Korra sets it back down and goes to exit the room. Then the journalists stand and explode with questions, all trying to get Korra's attention. The scene cuts to Mako and Asami riding in a taxi cab through a park at night. Romantic background music is playing.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> I know it sounds weird to say this but I'm really glad I hit you with my Moped. <br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(bashful)</i> Uh, aw, me too. <br><b>Asami:</b> I forgot to ask. Why didn't you accept the new silk scarf I bought for you last week? You didn't like it?<br><b>Mako:</b> No, it was really nice. But this scarf was my father's and it's all I have left of him. I just feel like, like it keeps me safe. <br><b>Asami:</b> I'm so sorry. I lost my mother when I was very young. <i>(Mako takes Asami's hand in his. They smile at each other for  moment before Asmi rests her head on his shoulder)</i> I feel so safe with you. <br><br><i>(The taxi rides off down the street by a pond, passing by other couples.

Tarrlok and members of his task force stand on the pier and Tenzin lands next to them.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Korra, this is madness!<br><b>Korra:</b> Don't try to stop me and don't follow me. I have to face Amon alone. <br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(to Tarrlok)</i> This is all your doing!<br><b>Tarrlok:</b> I tried to talk her out of it too but she's made up her mind. <i>(Korra uses waterbending to drive her boat over the water to Memorial Island)</i> We'll be watching the island closely. If anything goes wrong I have a fleet of police air ships ready to swoop down. <br><br><i>(The camera is positioned between Tarrlok and Tenzin, and zooms in on Korra as she approaches the island. The scene dissolves to a shot of Aang's statue, then tilts down to Korra waiting below. Cut to a wide shot of Korra standing on top of the statue's platform. A clock is positioned on top of the archway beneath. Cut to a close up of Korra's profile. A noise is heard and she looks to her left. The camera quickly zooms out as Korra turns and readies herself for a fight. Cut to a wide overhead shot of the roof. The music goes quiet. Cut back to Korra as she relaxes. She is surprised when a loud bell suddenly rings, and the camera zooms out quickly to show the clock beneath her, then to a close up of the clock with its hands pointing to midnight. As the clock's bell rings, we cut to different shots; first a cut to a wide pan shot of Republic City's skyline, then cut to a close up of the twelve symbol on the clock, a tilting up shot of the statue of Aang, then cut back to Korra as she sighs. Korra takes a deep breath, readying herself and flexing her arms. Cut to a shot from behind Korra as she looks out over the bay at Republic City. There is a dissolve to the same shot forward in time. Korra is sitting down and the Republic City is no longer lit up. Cut back in front of Korra as she yawns and stretches.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Guess you're a no-show, Amon. Who's scared now? <br><br><i>(Korra stands up and leaves. Cut to a shot of Korra on ground level near the archway. She begins to pass it by and puts her hands behind her head. Jump cut to a shot from within the darkened hallway, and the camera follows a bolo at the end of a rope as it flies through the air towards Korra's legs. The camera quickly tilts up to Korra's face, then cuts to a shot of her legs as they are tied together, tripping her. Korra has a moment to be surprised before she's dragged off into the dark passage, grunting in discomfort. As she is dragged, Korra manages to stick her legs into the air and break free with firebending. The passage is lit up and the camera reveals about two dozen chi blockers surrounding Korra as she gets to her feet. <br><br>Korra catches her breath, then turns and gasps as the passage goes pitch black, save for the glowing red goggles of the chi blockers. Korra firebends, spinning her fist around behind her and punching with the other, lighting up the passage as she keeps the chi blockers at bay. Her arms are caught by two bolos and she struggles to break free as two chi blockers leap at her. Korra kicks at them and sends another blast of fire, then knocks them away with another kick that earthbends the floor up beneath them. The passage darkens again as two chi blockers come up behind Korra and strike the pressure points in her back, paralyzing her, as everything fades to black.<br><br>Fade in to a tilting down shot of Korra lying on the ground, illuminted by a lantern and surrounded by a circle of chi blockers. Korra is lifted up by the arms by two of them. She pants softly as she regains consciousness, then looks up and gasps.

The music intensifies and we cut to a close shot of Korra as Amon instead grasps her by the chin, forcing her to look up at him)</i> Our showdown, while inevitable, is premature. Although it would be the simplist thing for me to take away your bending right now, I won't. You'd only become a martyr. Benders of every nation would rally behind your untimely demise. But I assure you I have a plan and I'm saving you for last. Then you'll get your duel and I will destroy you. <br><br><i>(Amon stands up from kneeling down and strikes a pressure point in Korra's shoulder to knock her out. Cut to Korra's point of view as she looks up at Amon, her vision blurring before falling to the floor. Fade to black, then quickly flash cut to a dream sequence in sepia tone. There is a quick series of shots separated by more flash cuts. First Sokka, then Toph with metalbending police, then Aang, then a close up of Yakone's eyes, then Aang riding an air scooter, looking angry and ready for battle. Cut to black, then fade back to Korra's point of view, still on the floor, as Tenzin runs towards her.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Aang?<br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(helping Korra sit up)</i> Korra! Korra, are you alright? What happened? Was Amon here? <br><b>Korra:</b> Ye-yeah. He ambushed me. <br><b>Tenzin:</b> Did he, did he take your bending away?<br><br><i>(Korra creates a small flame in her hand before clasping and extinguishing it.)</i> <br><br><b>Korra:</b> No. I'm okay. <br><b>Tenzin:</b> Oh, thank goodness.<br><br><i>(Korra's eyes quiver before she breaks down and cries, tears streaming down her cheeks. She leans into Tenzin, burying her head into his chest and hugging him close. Tenzin hugs her back gently to help comfort her.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> I was so terrified! I felt so helpless.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> It's alright. The nightmare is over. <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(sobbing)</i> You were right. I've been scared this whole time. I've never felt like this before and I don't know what to do. <br><b>Tenzin:</b> Admitting your fears is the first, and most difficult, step in overcoming them. <br><br><i>(The camera tilts upwards, away from Korra and Tenzin and into the darkness.)</i><br><br><br><br>[End Credits]<br>

Since Avatar Korra arrived in Republic City, she's only had eyes for one fellow, Mako. The feelings seemed mutual until a fateful accident intervened. Now Mako's affections have fallen right into the arms of beautiful Asami. Will love prove to be Korra's most formidable foe yet?<br><br><br><br><b><u>Act I</b></u><br><br><i>(Fade in to a bird's eye view of the pro bending arena. Snow is falling and fog covers the surrounding water. Cut to a close up of Korra in her training gear inside the training room. Jazz background music is playing. The camera zooms out as Korra bends two large balls of water and flings both of them forward. Cut to a shot of Bolin from the side and zoom out as he bends an earth disc in front of him to block one of Korra's attacks. Cut to Mako as he turns his body and firebends with a spinning back kick to block Korra's other water ball. He follows up with two quick fire blasts at Bolin. Cut to an overhead shot of the three of them. Bolin blocks Mako's attacks with an earth disc while Korra extracts more water from a water tank and flings it at Mako, who dodges it. Bolin throws an earth disc at Korra and Mako throws two simultaneous fireblasts at Korra and Bolin. Korra and Bolin block the fire blasts, but Mako follows up with another blast at Mako. Bolin is knocked down by Mako's fire blast, but throws an earth disc at Korra. Korra throws a water ball at Mako and it hit by Bolin's disc in the stomach, knocking her down. Mako is hit in the face by Korra's attack, and is knock on his back. All three sit up and share a laugh. Mako stands to his feet and takes off his head gear.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> It's been great having you in so many back to back practices Korra.<br><b>Korra:</b> Feels good to be back. Although Tarrlok isn't too happy about my leave of absence. <br><b>Bolin:</b> Hey, you joined the fire ferrets before you joined his task force. <br><b>Mako:</b> Okay, come on, team huddle time. <i>(cut to a floor level view looking straight up as the three of them huddle together, heads touching. Bolin smirks at Korra flirtatiously, and the camera pans to her as she smiles back awkwardly. Korra looks to Mako and grins at him, and the camera pans to Mako, who looks at Korra a bit uncomfortably)</i> Uhm, it's our first match of the tournament tonight. I know the three of us haven't been a team for very long, but even so, the fire ferrets have never been this good. Are we ready?<br><b>Korra and Bolin:</b> (<i>in unison</i>) We're ready!<br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(off screen)</i> Not quite. <i>(cut to Asami holding up a pro bending uniform)</i> You'll need these. <br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(walking to Asami)</i> Hey Asami.<br><b>Asami:</b> Good morning sweetie.<br><b>Mako:</b> These new uniforms look great.<br><b>Asami:</b> You look great champ.<br><br><i>(Mako and Asami chuckle softly and rub their noses together. The camera pans to Korra and Bolin as Korra acts disgusted by their affection, but acts natural when Mako speaks to them again.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Well teammates, I'll see you before the match tonight. Asami and I have a lunch date. <br><br><i>(Mako puts his arm around Asami and they both leave.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Albright, okay, we'll chat with you guys later, you know, see you when we see you. <i>(Korra goes to pick up her bag. Bolin slides next to Korra)</i> Sooo, Korra, there they go, here we are, all alone in the gym. Just you and me, two alone people. Together. Alone. <br><b>Korra:</b> Uh, I gotta head back to the air temple to train with Tenzin. See ya!<br><br><i>(Bolin looks away and sulks sadly as Korra brushes him off. Cut to a close up of a skillet over a burner cooking some hot steaming noodles as Mako tosses them a bit. Cut to a shot of the room above the bending arena, with Mako at the makeshift stove and Bolin sitting behind him. Bolin is holding Pabu over a basin of water.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Work with me here Pabu! You wanna look spic and span in your new uniform, don't you? <i>(Bolin lowers Pabu down to the water, but Pabu resists, pushes his legs against the edges of the basin. Pabu struggles a bit more before Bolin manages to get him in the water. Pabu is soaked, shaking the water from his head and sneezing. Bolin speaks To Mako as he washes Pabu)</i> So, what do you think of Korra in a girlfriend sort of way?<br><b>Mako:</b> She's great, but I think it makes more sense for me to go for Asami. <br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(annoyed)</i> I was talking about a girlfriend for me. Leave some ladies for the rest of us. <br><b>Mako:</b> I know, that's what I thought you meant. <br><b>Bolin:</b> Well?<br><b>Mako:</b> I dunno Bo, it doesn't seem like a good idea for you to date Korra. <br><b>Bolin:</b> You just said she was great two seconds ago. <br><b>Mako:</b> Yeah, Korra's a great athlete, an Avatar and stuff. But I dunno if she's really girlfriend material. She's more like a pal.<br><b>Bolin:</b> Bro, you're nuts. Korra and I are perfect for each other. She's strong, I'm strong. She's fun, I'm fun. She's beautiful, I'm gorgeous! <i>(Pabu tries to sneak away, but Bolin picks him up)</i> Okay, I don't care what you think, I'm gonna ask Korra out. <br><b>Mako:</b> Look, it just isn't smart to date a teammate, especially during the tournament. Keep your head out of the clouds and your priorities straight, okay?<br><b>Bolin:</b> (<i>sighing</i>) Yeah, yeah I know. Guh. You know what I'm talking about Pabu. I'm talkin' about real love.<br><br><i>(Cut to a close up of Pabu looking at Bolin, his fur dripping wet. Pabu chirps and tilts his head to the side. The scene changes to Airbender Island. The sun is setting over the water, and the ground is covered in snow. The camera pans right to show Korra, Ikki, and Jinora by a small lit up pagoda. Cut to a shot of Korra on top of a ladder filling a cage with food. Jinora is holding the ladder steady. Three flying lemurs climb down from above to eat the food as Korra climbs down.)</i><br><br><b>Jinora:</b> So, how's it going with the tall, dreamy firebender boy? You've been spending a lot of time together lately. <br><b>Ikki:</b> Oooh, yeah! Tell us all about the magical romance. <br><b>Korra:</b> What? Listen to you two. I'm not interested in Mako or any romantic stuff. Besides, he's all into that prissy, beautiful elegant rich girl...But let's just pretend for a second that I am interested in him, what would I do?<br><b>Jinora:</b> Oooh! I just read a historical saga where the heroine fell in love with the enemy general son who's supposed to marry the princess. You should do what she did.<br><b>Korra:</b> (<i>excited</i>) Tell me!<br><b>Jinora:</b> She rode a dragon into battle and burned down the entire country. Then she jumped into a volcano. <i>(clasps hands together)</i> It was so romantic. <br><b>Korra:</b> Uhh...<br><b>Ikki:</b> No, no, no! The best way to win a boy's heart is to brew a love potion of rainbows and sunsets that makes true lovers sprout wings and fly to a magical castle in the sky where they get married and eat clouds with spoons and use stars as ice cubes in their moonlight punch, <i>(spins into the air)</i> forever and ever and ever!<br><br><i>(Ikki slowly floats back down.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> The volcano is starting to make more sense to me now. <br><br><i>(Laughing is heard off screen, and the camera pans right to show Pema standing behind them.)</i> <br><br><b>Korra:</b> Oh, hey Pema... Uh, how long where you standing there?<br><b>Pema:</b> Long enough. But trust me, I know what you're going through. Years ago I was in the exact same situation with Tenzin. <br><b>Ikki:</b> (<i>surprised</i>)Daddy was in love with someone else before you?<br><b>Pema:</b> That's right. <br><b>Korra:</b> So what did you do?<br><b>Pema:</b> Well, for the longest time I did nothing. I was so shy and scared of rejection, but watching my soul mate spend his life with the wrong woman became too painful. So I hung my chin out there and I confessed my love to Tenzin. And the rest is history. <br><br><i>(Jinora, Ikki and Korra sigh wistfully in unison. Korra pauses to think a moment. Cut to a close up of Korra and zooms in as she smiles. The scene cuts to a shot of the pro bending arena, all lit up at night.)</i><br><br><b>Radio Broadcaster:</b> <i>(off screen)</i> Folks, after a year of waiting the pro-bending championship tournament is finally here. <i>(cut to the inside of the arena, where spotlights hit the arena platform)</i> Tonight is the first set of matches our single elimination 16-team bracket. <i>(cut to the Radio Commentator)</i> And I gotta tell you these are the most tenacious and talented bending trios this arena has ever seen.<br><br><i>(Cut to a shot of Korra, Mako, and Bolin as they ride a platform to the edge of the arena floor. They are all wearing the Future Industries uniforms and the spotlight is illuminating them.)</i><br><br><b>Ring Announcer:</b> Introducing our first team; the Future Industry's Fire Ferrets! <i>(cut to  closer shot of the Fire Ferrets as they wave to the crowd. Cut to a shot of the crowd cheering, then cut to a tilting up shot of the opposing team)</i> And their opponents; the Red Sand's Rabaroos!<br><br><i>(Cut to Mako, Bolin, and Korra staring back at the other team. Mako looks determined as he adjusts his arm guard. Cut to the Rabaroos getting ready. Cut to a close up of the Fire Ferrets' feet as they get into their stances. The bell rings and the camera quickly zooms out to show the teams facing each other before they all throw their attacks. The elements collide and explode, pushing all of them away from the middle. Cut to two of the Rabaroos as they recover. The earthbender Rabaroo stomps her foot and picks up two earth discs before flinging them past the camera.)</i> <br><br><b>Radio Broadcaster:</b> What an explosive opening volley. Both teams quickly recover and unleash a barrage of bending. <i>(the camera pans left to show the firebender and waterbender Rabaroos attacking as well. Cut to a floor level shot of Korra as she throws a ball of water to extinguish a fireball, then somersaults out of the way of the incoming earth discs and a second fireball. Korra lands near Mako, who destroys a disc that was about to hit Korra with a fireball. Korra picks up some water and sends it to the other side while Mako dodges a fire blast. The camera pans left to show Bolin popping up a disc and launching it to the other side)</i> I am astonished by the level of improvement displayed here by the Fire Ferrets. <i>(cut to a close up of the firebender Rabaroo as she looks worried, then zoom out to show her blocking Korra's attack before getting hit in the stomach by Bolin's disc and sent across the line. The buzzer sounds, then cut to a shot of the crowd cheering)</i> No wonder the Avatar has been absent from the papers lately. She's obviously had her nose to the grindstone in the gym. <i>(cut to the Fire Ferrets advancing into the next zone when the line turns green. Cut to an overhead shot of the two teams exchanging attacks. Cut to Korra as she throws out another water ball)</i> The Ferrets advance in Rabaroo territory and are holding nothing back. <i>(cut to Mako shooting three fire blasts before dropping to the ground to avoid a water blast)</i> Nice sprawl there by Mako. <i>(cut to a shot of Bolin's feet as he stomps hard and pops up a disc. The camera follows the disc up as Bolin swings his arm and flings it)</i> Bolin strikes. <i>(cut to a panning right shot of the Rabaroos as they are hit by the Fire Ferrets barrage. The firebender is knocked down by Korra, then the Earthbender hops out of the way of Bolin's disc which hits the floor)</i> Oola dodges. <i>(the waterbender catches the earthbender as she is pushed back into her, then they are hit by Mako's fire blast, followed by another earth disc from Bolin which knocks the two of them down)</i> And all three Rabaroos are down. The Fire Ferrets easily take round one.<br><br><i>(Cut to an overhead shot of the arena as the bell rings. Cut to a shot of the game announcer holding a microphone as he announces the second round and throws his hand out to the side with two fingers pointed.)</i><br><br><b>Ring Announcer:</b> Round two!<br><br><i>(The bell rings and we cut to a shot of one of the grates on the floor and tilt up as the waterbender Rabaroo pulls up some water and throws it, while the firebender kicks out a fire blast and is almost hit by an attack from Korra.)</i><br><br><b>Radio Broadcaster:</b> The Rabaroos are looking for payback and they go straight after Bolin. <i>(the waterbender's attack collides with Bolin, who is pushed back. He pops up a disc and uses it to block another water blast. Korra jumps in front of Bolin)</i> Korra comes to his defense. <i>(Korra throws a glob of water past the screen. Cut to Rabaroos as the waterbender is knocked back by Korra, tumbling past the line. The firebender throws out more blasts)</i> And she wholla-whacks Uma back into zone two. <i>(cut to Mako as he kicks an incoming disc into dust and jumps out of the way of another as he kicks out a fire ball. As soon as he lands Mako ducks under a water blast and follows up with two spinning fire kicks. Meanwhile, Bolin throws out an earth disc, rolls out of the way of a fire blast, and throw another disc)</i> The Ferrets are on fire tonight and they win round two.<br><br><i>(Cut to a shot of the crowd cheering, then to the announcer as he spins around and holds up three fingers and the bell rings.)</i><br><br><b>Ring Announcer:</b> Round three!<br><br><i>(Cut to the waterbender Rabaroo with the earthbender in the background. The waterbender throws out two water blasts, and the earthbender does a spinning jump only to be knocked down over the line in mid air by a disc.)</i><br><br><b>Radio Broadcaster:</b> With the Rabaroos down two rounds, they'll need a knockout to win. <i>(Bolin dodges a water blast and Mako throws out a fire blast. Bolin flings an earth disc and ducks as Mako does a jumping, spinning heel kick over his head and flings an arc of fire)</i> And with the way the Fire Ferrets are playing, I don't see that happening. <i>(cut to the earthbender Rabaroo tumbling back across the line after being hit by the fire blast, landing on her hands and knees. The firebender Rabaroo is also pushed back. Cut to a close up of the earthbender as she pants, then looks up and glares, determined and angry before getting back up. Cut to a shot of Korra s she throws out a combination of water jabs and an uppercut followed by a spinning back kick. Transition to Bolin as he does his own combination of punches, grunting and throwing out earth discs)</i> These Ferrets are working together like a well oiled bending machine. <i>(the disc smashes into the firebender Rabaroo and she is knocked over the line. The Fire Ferrets advance to the next zone)</i> Bolin bashes Ottie into zone two and the Ferrets get the green light to advance. <i>(cut to the crowd cheering, then cut to the earthbender Rabaroo getting hit by a water blast, then cut to the waterbender as she is pushed back by an earth disc, then hit with a fire ball in the side causing her to stumble, and then knocked back a zone by  water blast)</i> The Rabaroos are just fighting to stay on their feet at this point. Down goes Ottie, Oola and Uma. <i>(cut to an overhead shot as the firebender Rabaroo is knocked back a zone by a water blast, followed by the earthbender from a fire blast, and finally the waterbender by an earth disc. Cut to a wide shot of the arena floor and zoom out as the bell rings.)</i> <br><b>Ring Announcer:</b> All three rounds go to the Future Industry's Fire Ferrets, who win their opening match of the tournament!<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(jumping)</i> Woohooo!<br><b>Mako:</b> Yes!<br><b>Bolin:</b> That's what I'm talking about. <i>(the three share a group hug. Cut to the Rabaroos sulking after their defeat, then to Mako and Korra as they walk away from the arena floor to the lockers, with Bolin staying to wave to the crowd in the background)</i> Thank you! Thank you!<br><b>Mako:</b> Wow, we were really connecting out there in that ring. <br><b>Korra:</b> Yeah! You know, I feel like the two of us have been connecting really well out of the ring too. <br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(putting his helmet away)</i> Uh, sure. <br><b>Korra:</b> So I was thinking we should spend some time together.<br><b>Mako:</b> We've been spending lots of time together. <br><b>Korra:</b> I mean outside of the gym, and not while searching for kidnapped family members or fighting chi-blockers. <br><b>Mako:</b> I don't know. Asami and I are... <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(interrupting, rushing in close and speaking quickly)</i> Look, I really like you and I think we were meant for each other.<br><br><i>(Mako turns away, and Korra hides her face in embarrassment.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Korra, I'm really sorry but I just don't feel the same way about you. <br><b>Korra:</b> Forget I ever said anything.<br><br><i>(Korra walks towards the nearby table as Bolin walks into the locker area and Asami enters through the door with Pabu on her shoulder, who jumps to the floor with a chirp.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> Congratulations guys! You were so amazing out there.<br><br><i>(Asami walks up to Mako to give him a kiss on the cheek. Mako and Korra share a glance, with Korra looking on sadly and turning away. Mako frowns a moment before turning his attention back to Asami and walking away with her. Cut to Bolin leaning on the table and looking at Korra.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> So, Korra, I was thinkin'; you and me, we could go get some dinner together. Sort of a date situation. <br><b>Korra:</b> Oh, that's really sweet but I don't think so. I don't feel very date-worthy.<br><b>Bolin:</b> Are you kidding me? You're the smartest, funniest, toughest, buffest, talentedest, incrediblest girl in the world!<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(giggles and smiles)</i> You really feel that way about me?<br><b>Bolin:</b> I felt that way since the moment I saw you! Trust me, I know we're going to have so much fun together.<br><br><i>(Cut to a close up of Mako's face as he smiles at Asami in front of him, then pan left and focus on Korra and Bolin in the background. Mako turns his head to listen and frowns.)</i> <br><br><b>Korra:</b> You know what? I could use some fun. Okay, sure. <br><b>Bolin:</b> Yes! Who's the luckiest guy in the world? Right here, Bolin!<br><br><i>(The camera focuses back on Mako. He turns his head a bit more to watch as Korra and Bolin leave through the door, with Bolinís hand on Korra's shoulder.

You love Watertribe food, I love Watertribe food. Just another reason we are so great together. <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(slurps up noodles)</i> They are good noodles. <i>(looks behind Bolin)</i> Hey, who's that creepy guy over there that keeps glaring at us. <br><br><i>(Cut to a shot of Tahno, his teammates, and three girls sitting in a booth and pan right slowly. Tahno has his arms around two of the girls, and they are all staring in Korra's direction.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> That's Tahno and the Wolfbats. The reigning champs three years running. Don't make eye contact. <i>(Korra looks up at Tahno and glares at him. Cut to Tahno smirking as one girl whispers something to him. He stands up and the girls giggle, then signals his group to follow him to Korra and Bolin's table)</i> Uh-oh, here he comes. Now don't mess with this guy. He's a nasty dude.<br><br><i>(Bolin looks back to see Tahno approaching. He gasps and tries to calmly eat his noodles. Cut to a shot from the side as Tahno walks up to Korra.)</i><br><br><b>Tahno:</b> Well, well, well, if it isn't the Fire Ferrets, probending's saddest excuse for a team. Tell me, how do a couple of armatures like you luck your way into the tournament? Especially you, Avatar. <i>(Korra huffs in annoyance and Tahno leans in very close to her)</i> You know, if you'd like to learn how a real pro bends, I could give you some private lessons. <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(standing up and glaring)</i> You want to go toe to toe with me, pretty boy?<br><b>Tahno:</b> Go for it. I'll give you the first shot.<br><br><i>(The camera zooms out to show Bolin hunched over below them.)</i> <br><br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(whispering)</i> Korra, don't. He's just trying to bait you.

Romantic music plays and the scene cuts to Korra and Bolin in a soda bar, drinking glasses of soda through straws. Bolin burps, then blushes and covers his mouth in embarrassment. Korra lets out a burp too and Bolin smiles in delight. He burps loudly and crosses his arms and smiles proudly. Korra smiles before her cheeks puff out a moment and she lets out a very loud burp which makes the screen shake. There's a moment's pause before Korra and Bolin hold their sides laughing.

Korra does a cartwheel to avoid an earth disc and collides into Mako by accident, the scene going into slow motion as they fall, fire and water surrounding them.)</i><br><br><b>Radio Broadcaster:</b> Korra dodges and ooh! Slams right into her teammate. <i>(an earth disc flies and curves through the air. Cut to an overhead shot of Mako getting hit and sent over the line, followed by his teammates)</i> Down goes Mako, and Bolin and Korra. <br><br><i>(Cut to the ring announcer.)</i><br><br><b>Ring Announcer:</b> Round one goes to the Borqupines!<br><br><i>(Cut to the Borqupines stretching and posing in victory. Cut to the Fire Ferrets. Bolin quietly watches as Korra and Mako argue.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> You were supposed to defend while I attacked!<br><b>Korra:</b> I had an opening so I took it!<br><b>Bolin:</b> What is up with you two? Alright, whatever, just pull it together guys.<br><br><i>(Cut to a close up of the bell as it rings again. Cut to Mako and Bolin throwing fire and earth discs.)</i><br><br><b>Radio Broadcaster:</b> The Ferrets looking to mount some offense here in round two. <br><br><i>(The camera quickly pans right as an earth disc strikes the firebender Borqupine, and the scene goes into slow motion as he reels and is knocked back. Pan right to the waterbender as he flings a stream of water, then pan left to see the water hitting Mako and knocking him down. Quickly pan right again to see the earthbender Borqupine being hit by a disc. Cut to Bolin as he goes on the attack, throwing out several discs with punches and kicks and dodging incoming attacks.)</i><br><br><b>Radio Broadcaster:</b> Bolin lets fly a flurry of attacks. He's a one man bending battalion. <i>(Bolin grunts and flings a disc, which strikes the opposing firebender. The opponent is knocked in the air and sent over the line)</i> The Ferrets having a tough time finding their rhythm tonight but thanks to Bolin they narrowly notch round two. <br><br><i>(Bolin catches his breath a moment before smirking triumphantly. Cut to the bell being rung and then to Korra as she swings her arm in a wide arc, throwing a stream of water, then to a close up of the firebender Borqupine as he throws a fire blast, then to a close up of Mako as he deflects some water and throws his own fire blast. There is a flash cut to a freeze frame of the waterbender Borqupine doing a roundhouse kick, then zoom out to show Mako getting hit by the water.)</i><br><br><b>Radio Broadcaster:</b> Not sure what's eaten them but this is not the same team that took out the Rabaroos. <br><br><i>(Flash cut to a freeze frame of Bolin hit by an earth disc, then another flash cut to a shot of Korra also hit by a disc. The buzzer sounds and we cut to the announcer.)</i><br><br><b>Ring Announcer:</b> Round three is a tie. We go to a tie-breaker to decide the match!<br><br><i>(Cut to a close up of a coin being held up to the light by the referee. He turns it to show it has a red side and a blue side. Cut to a shot of the two teams facing each other in the center, with the referee between them. He throws it in the air, and the camera cut to a close up of the coin and follows it as it spins and falls back down. The referee catches it and opens his hands to show the red side facing up.)</i><br><br><b>Referee:</b> The Fire Ferrets win the coin toss. Which element do you choose?<br><b>Mako:</b> I got this. <br><b>Bolin:</b> I know you usually handle these but frankly your head's not in the game. I'm gonna take this one. <i>(steps forward)</i> We choose earth. <br><br><i>(Everyone except the earthbenders step away from the center ring, which rises up, creating a platform.)</i><br><br><b>Radio Broadcaster:</b> Looks like the earthbenders will collide in the tie breaker face-off.<br><br><i>(Cut to a close up of Bolin as he readies himself, then to the Borqupine earthbender who does the same. The bell rings, and the two approach each other. Each stomps and summons three discs. Bolin throws two while the Borqupine blocks them with one. The Borqupine throws another and Bolin blocks it with his third. The scene goes into slow motion. The Borqupine attempts to use the dust cloud to mask his movement as he jumps forward and does a flying knee to send his last disc out. Bolin rolls underneath him and they switch sides. The face each other again and Bolin lunges, grabbing the Borqupine around the waist, but he sprawls his legs back.)</i><br><br><b>Radio Broadcaster:</b> Bolin goes in for the grapple. <i>(the earthbender locks his hands under Bolin's stomach and throws his into the air behind him)</i> Chang reverses. <i>(while in the air, Bolin summons a disc and throws it at the earthbender Borqupine, pushing him back)</i> Bolin strikes from mid-air knocking Chang to the edge of the circle. <i>(the earthbender is stunned a moment. Bolin lands on his feet, summons two discs, and sends flings them both with a spinning hook kick. Cut to a shot of the earthbender and zoom in as he is struck, sending him flying back and into the water below)</i> Another strike from Bolin and Chang's in the drink.<br><br><i>(The bell rings the end of the match. Bolin cheers, jumps up and down and waves as the crowd roars and throws streamers.)</i><br><br><b>Ring Announcer:</b> The Future Industry's Fire Ferrets win their quarter-final match.<br><br><i>(Cut to Mako and Korra and they sigh in relief. They glance at each other a moment before looking away angrily and pouting.)</i><br><br><b>Radio Broadcaster:</b> Oh, that was a close one folks. Youth trumps experience tonight. <br><br><i>(Dissolve to a shot of Korra standing under a gazebo outside the arena, leaning against a pillar and looking out across the water. Mako walks on camera and into the foreground, approaching Korra. Cut to in front of them.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> We need to talk. Look, sometimes you can be so infuriating. <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(interrupting)</i> Save your breath. You've already made it clear how you feel about me. <br><b>Mako:</b> No, I haven't. What I'm trying to say is, as much as you drive me crazy, I also think you're pretty amazing. <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(turning to face Mako)</i> So, you do like me?<br><b>Mako:</b> Yes, but- <i>(sigh)</i> I like Asami too. I dunno, things are complicated. Been feeling really confused and I-<br><br><i>(Mako is interrupted as Korra quickly leans in and kisses him on the lips. He's shocked for a moment before kissing back and making Korra blush. They break the kiss and stare into each other's eyes, then Korra looks past Mako and her eyes and mouth go wide in shock. She turns and looks away shamefully as Mako turns around and the camera pans right to see Bolin standing behind him. Cut to a close up of Bolin holding a bouquet of pink roses for Korra, with Pabu on his shoulder and zoom in. Bolin is shocked, and a passing breeze blows his hair and some petals off the roses. Pabu chirps and looks at Bolin. There's silence for a moment before Bolin's face contorts and he lets out a mournful yet humorous wail, tears and mucous forming around his eyes and nose.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Bolin, this isn't what you think! <i>(Bolin turns and runs away crying, dropping the flowers. Mako turns to Korra)</i> Great, look what you did!<br><b>Korra:</b> You're blaming me?<br><b>Mako:</b> You kissed <i>me</i><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>You</i> kissed me back!<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(frustrated)</i> Ugh!<br><br><i>(Korra pouts angrily as Mako runs off to catch up with Bolin. Korra looks down and frowns sadly after seeing him go.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Well played, Korra. <br><br><i>(Cut to commercial.)</i><br><br><br><br><b><u>Act III</b></u><br><br><i>(Fade in to the interior of a Water Tribe restaurant as Mako enters and greets a man at the front desk.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> 'Morning Narook. My brother here? <i>(the man gestures to behind Mako and he turns to look, seeing Bolin slumped over a table)</i> Thanks. <i>(Mako walks over to Bolin and puts a hand on his back. Pabu is lying back in a bowl, his belly swollen and full of noodles)</i> Come on, wake up. Takin' you home bro. <br><br><i>(Bolin looks up to Mako, his face still forlorn, dark bags under his eyes and a green noodle sticking out of his nose. He sniffs the noodle back up.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(delirious with sadness)</i> Don't call me that. You're not my brother. You're a brother betrayer. The only one I can trust anymore is Pabu. Pabu loves me. <br><br><i>(Pabu turns to look at Bolin and acts disinterested.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> You're a mess and we've got the biggest match of our lives tonight. Let's go. <br><br><i>(Mako touches Bolin's shoulder, but he pushes Mako's hand away.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> No! I'm not going anywhere with you, you traitor. <br><b>Mako:</b> Guess we'll have to do this the hard way. <br><br><i>(Mako grabs Bolin by the arm and slings his whole body over his shoulder before carrying him out. Pabu slips out of the bowl.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(sobbing)</i> Why?<br><b>Mako:</b> I told you dating a teammate what a bad idea. <br><b>Bolin:</b> You're a bad idea. Put me down! Put me down.<br><br><i>(Mako carries Bolin out of the restaurant. Pabu flops down to the floor and scurries after them, his full belly dragging over the floor. Cut to an establishing shot of the pro-bending area at night, with the skylights sweepings back and forth and the crowd entering through the front. Cut to the locker room as Korra enters. She sees Bolin sitting on the bench, turned away from her and hunched over sadly. Korra looks away a moment before walking to her locker. She passes Mako, who ignores her, and she grabs her hear. Cut to an overhead shot of the three of them as they stay silent and avoid looking at each other. Cut to a shot from the arena floor as the Fire Ferrets and their opposing team face each other at the center. Cut to a close shot of the Buzzard Wasps and pan left as the three of them stare down the Fire Ferrets.)</i><br><br><b>Radio Broadcaster:</b> You can't find two teams more matched in age, size and strength than the Fire Ferrets and the Buzzard Wasps. Believe me, I've looked. This should be a pulse-pounding semi-final folks. <br><br><i>(Cut to a far shot as the teams take their positions. The bell rings, and we cut to the Buzzard Wasps jumping backward and all attacking in unison. The Fire Ferrets try to dodge and deflect the incoming elements, but end up getting hit.)</i><br><br><b>Radio Broadcaster:</b> The Buzzard Wasps open with a flawlessly executed combo. <i>(Korra, Mako, and Bolin are all pushed into the next zone)</i> All three Ferrets take an early visit to zone two. <i>(Mako deflects a water glob but is struck by another and knocked back again)</i> And Mako is knocked all the way to zone three! The Fire Ferrets have been struggling to stay alive since the opening bell. <i>(Korra and Bolin go on the attack. Bolin dodges a fire blast, then summons two discs and throwing them, deflecting another earth disc with his second)</i> All three players are totally out of sync tonight. <i>(Bolin is hit hard in the stomach with a disc)</i> Oooh. That has got to sting. <i>(Bolin clutches his stomach and his eyes go wide. He staggers over to the ropes, throws his helmet off, and leans over the side. Cut to Korra as we hear Bolin retch. She turns to look and winces in disgust)</i> And Bolin loses his noodles. Literally. <i>(cut to the commentator in his booth)</i> Which reminds me this match is brought to you by our sponsor, Flame-o Instant Noodles. Noodliest noodles in the United Republic. <br><br><i>(Cut back to the match as the teams keep fighting. Korra does a jumping spinning crescent kick to dodge a water blast, but is hit in mid air by a disc and sent over the line. Cut to an overhead shot of the zone two line lighting up, with the Fire Ferrets all in zone three. The Buzzard wasps move into zone two.)</i><br><br><b>Radio Broadcaster:</b> The Buzzard Wasps fly deeper into Ferret territory. <i>(the Fire Ferrets get ready and attack. The Buzzard Wasps all defend and strike back. Mako dodges a fire blast and deflects some water, dodges a disc and another fire blast, then is hit by another disc, getting knocked over the edge and into the water)</i> And Mako plunges into the pool. Can the Fire Ferrets hold on? <i>(Korra and Bolin dodge and deflect more attacks. Korra's foot comes very close to the edge)</i> The Wasps have the Ferrets backed up to the edge now. <i>(the bell rings)</i> And the Ferrets are bailed out by the bell. <i>(the Buzzard Wasps turns and leave, each dropping their element and looking confident)</i> They had better pull themselves together for round two, otherwise they can kiss the finals goodbye. <br><br><i>(Korra and Bolin catch their breath, then sigh in relief. They turn around and the camera focuses on Mako riding the platform back up from below. Cut to a close up of the bell being rung, then to a shot of the Fire ferrets all attacking. The Buzzard Wasps all defend and strike back. Mako deflects an earth disc, but is struck by a second one and knocked over the line. He lands on his feet and shoots a strong blast of fire only to hit Bolin in the back, knocking him on his face. Bolin sits up and turns to Mako.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Hey! Watch it!<br><br><i>(When Bolin isn't looking, he's hit by the waterbender Buzzard Wasp and sent over the edge of the arena.)</i><br><br><b>Radio Broadcaster:</b> The Wasps take advantage of Mako's unforced error and Bolin's in the pool. <i>(cut to Korra deflecting streams of water. She pulls out a stream of her own from the grates, first to attack, and then sends it towards the firebender Wasp. Korra wraps it around her leg and trips her before sending the firebender into the air with a geyser of water from the grate below)</i> Ooh, and a blatant hold by the Avatar. <br><br><i>(A whistle blows, and we cut to a different referee up above blowing it.)</i><br><br><b>Referee 2:</b> Unnecessary roughness! Move back one Zone.<br><br><i>(Cut to Korra and the crowd boos.)</i> <br><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(angry)</i> I'll unnecessary rough you up!<br><br><i>(Korra pulls some water out and throws it at the referee. The referee shields himself from the splash and pulls out a yellow fan.)</i><br><br><b>Radio Broadcaster:</b> And the Avatar is slapped with the yellow fan. The Ferrets are their own worst enemy right now. <i>(Korra shrugs her shoulder as she walks back a zone. Mako watches her, and in the background one Buzzard Wasp is helping his teammate back up.)</i> It's just sad to watch. With the Buzzard Wasps leading two rounds to zilch, the Ferret's only hope of winning is with a knockout.<br><br><i>(Cut to an overhead shot of the arena, with all players back on the field. Cut to Mako and Bolin as they face Korra, looking defeated.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Well, I guess there's always next year. <br><b>Korra:</b> Come on, we still have a chance, even if it is a slim one. <br><b>Bolin:</b> The way we're playing, we don't even deserve to be in the finals. <br><b>Korra:</b> Look, if we don't pull together and work as a team we'll never forgive ourselves. <br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(dejected)</i> Lets just get this over with, the sooner the better. <br><br><i>(Mako and Bolin hang their heads as they walk to the center. Korra soon does the same. The three of them take their positions and their stances. The camera pans around to Korra's front as the looks at the two brothers, and the bell rings. Korra narrowly dodges an earth disc. Cut to the Buzzard Wasps attacking with a lot of pressure. Cut to Mako getting hit and pushed back by a stream of water, then dodging another stream and a disc and attack back before getting hit in the side by a blast of fire. Cut to a shot of Mako stumbling behind Bolin. Bolin stomps and uses a disc to block a torrent of water, but is hit by a disc, followed by another torrent of water. He is knocked back across the line and past Mako, who deflects a fire blast. Mako is distracted by Bolin, and is hit by a disc, pushing him back and making his foot skid over the line.)</i><br><br><b>Radio Broadcaster:</b> Bolin's knocked into zone two followed quickly by his brother. <i>(Mako and Bolin compose themselves, and we cut to the earthbender Buzzard Wasp popping up two discs and sending them flying with a hook punch and spinning hook kick. Bolin dodges one, but is struck in the shoulder by the other. Cut to a close up of Bolin as the action replays and goes into slow motion)</i> And Bolin takes a zinger to the shoulder. Looks like it's a clean hit. <br><br><i>(Bolin is knocked against the ropes and falls to his knees. He puts his hand to his shoulder and grimaces.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Ow!<br><br><i>(Mako dodges a stream of water and turns to Bolin.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Bolin!<br><br><i>(Mako is hit by a blast of fire while distracted, and sent over the edge of the arena again.)</i><br><br><b>Radio Broadcaster:</b> Mako's in the drink and out of the match. <i>(Bolin pulls himself up by the ropes and summons a disc to fling back)</i> And Bolin keeps playing with one good arm. I gotta hand it to him, this kid's got grit. <i>(Korra dodges a fore blast while Bolin kicks a disc past her head. She glances back. Cut to the Buzzard Wasps' water and earthbenders on the attack, throwing a disc and torrent of water. Bolin's discs miss them, then cut back to Korra and Bolin)</i> But how long can he keep it up? <i>(Korra dodges a disc, which curves around and knock Bolin's feet out from under him before he's hit with the torrent of water and sent flying over the edge. Korra looks back before barely dodging a disc and deflecting some water. She throws a stream of water back.)</i> Apparently not very long. <i>(Korra proceeds to dodge several attacks with Airbending style movements and footwork, leaping back towards the edge of the zone)</i> The Ferretís dream of making it to the final now rests in the Avatar's hands. But with three on one I don't like her odds. <br><br><i>(Cut to a close up of Bolin's hand as he climbs the ladder up from the pool. Cut to a shot of him from the front as he reaches the top, groaning and stopping to catch his breath. Mako walks into view and kneels down, offering Bolin his hand and smiling. Bolin takes his hand, and we cut to a close up of their hands grasping. Mako pulls Bolin up to the ground, and Bolin rubs his shoulder.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Are you okay? How's your shoulder?<br><b>Bolin:</b> Aagh, it's messed up pretty bad. But I think I'll be alright. <i>Bolin and Mako walk over to the lift and ride it up. There's a short moment of silence)</i> Are we...gonna be alright?<br><b>Mako:</b> Of course we are. We're brothers. We'll get through this mess. I'm sorry. <br><b>Bolin:</b> Me too. Girls. <br><b>Mako:</b> Seriously. <br><br><i>(Cut to behind Mako and Bolin as they reach the top, and we see Korra still on the platform dodging the Buzzard Wasps' attacks.)</i><br><br><b>Radio Broadcaster:</b> What an unbelievable effort here by Korra. She's dodging every element the Wasps throw at her. <i>(Korra does a jumping tornado kick and throws a large glob of water with it. It strikes the firebender Wasp and knocks her into zone three. The earthbender watches his teammate fly past him before popping up a disc and doing a jumping roundhouse kick to fling it at Korra. He's quickly followed up by the waterbender throwing a stream of water with a hook punch. Korra jumps and spins in the air to dodge the attacks, and uses her momentum to do another tornado kick and hit the waterbender, knocking him to the side)</i> The Avatar finally gains some ground but with only ten second remaining it might be too little too late. <i>(cut to an overhead shot of the arena floor. The Buzzard Wasps are each in a different zone and all lined up. Cut to Korra as she creates a ring of water around her. Korra spins and crouches down, making the water spin around her. Korra charges her attack, then redirects the spinning ring of water, shooting it as a torrent towards the Buzzard Wasps. The camera follows the torrent as it approaches, then cut to a side shot as the torrent hits the waterbender, knocking him back into the earthbender, then knocking them into the firebender and sending them all over the edge)</i> It's the big kabash! What a knockout! <i>(the bell rings, and we cut to a wide angle shot of the arena as the crowd goes wild. Camera lights flicker and people whistle. Cut to Bolin and Mako in the locker room cheering triumphantly, then to a Korra. The camera pans around her as she smiles and waves to the crowd)</i> It didn't seem possible folks, but the Fire Ferrets are headed to the finals!<br><br><i>(Mako and Bolin cheer, and Mako gives his brother a hug, causing him to wince in pain.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Shoulder, shoulder!<br><b>Mako:</b> Sorry. <br><br><i>(Mako lets Bolin down, and Korra approaches them, taking off her helmet.</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> That was pretty much the coolest thing I've ever seen. <br><b>Mako:</b> Thanks for not giving up on us. We never would've made it this far without you. I owe you, big time. <br><b>Korra:</b> You're welcome. So, I know things are confusing right now, but I hope we can still be friends. <br><b>Mako:</b> Definitely.<br><br><i>(Cut to a shot of Tahno and the Wolfbats entering the locker room, wearing their gear. Tahno holds his helmet over his shoulder. Tahno sniffs the air, then stops, his face crunching in disgust as he waves his hand over his nose.)</i> <br><br><b>Tahno:</b> Oh. Ooh. You boys smell something in here? <i>(pinches his nose and continues walking)</i> Wait, I know what that is and that's the scent of losers. <br><b>Korra:</b> I hope we see you in the finals. Then we'll see who the losers really are. <br><b>Tahno:</b> Yeah, I'm peein' my pants over here.<br><br><i>(Tahno puts on his head gear. He and the Wolfbats stand on the platform and are introduced.)</i>  <br><br><b>Ring Announcer:</b> And now the defending champs the White Falls' Wolfbats.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(gripping her fist and frowning angrily)</i> Grrrr<br><br><i>(The camera pans left to show Asami running up to Mako and giving him a hug. Bolin winces and touches his shoulder before going to sit on the bench.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> Great job! What a comeback Korra. I've never seen a hat trick like that. <br><b>Korra:</b> Thanks. But if it hadn't been for you and your father we wouldn't have had the chance to play. So thank you. <br><b>Bolin:</b> Uh, if everyone's done with the thank you party, need some medical attention over here. <br><br><i>(Bolin has his sleeve off and is gently rubbing the bruise on his shoulder.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Ooh, let me help. <br><br><i>(Korra walks over to Bolin and touches his bruise, making him shout in pain.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Ow! Gah, haven't you hurt me enough woman?<br><b>Korra:</b> Relax! I'm a healer. I learned from Katara, the best there is. <br><br><i>(Korra bends the water from a nearby bucket of ice water and brings it to Bolin's shoulder. It begins to glow before she brings it to the bruise and starts healing. Bolin protests, but soon finds it soothing.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> No no no no, oh. That's the stuff. <br><b>Korra:</b> Bolin, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. I didn't mean to let things get so out of hand. <br><b>Bolin:</b> Aah, I'll be alright. We had fun together, didn't we?<br><b>Korra:</b> I had a great time, honestly. You are one of a kind Bolin. <br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(smirking)</i>Please, go on. I enjoy praise.<br><br><i>(In the background, the sound of bells and buzzers is heard from the Wolfbats' match. The final bell signaling the end of the match rings, and Korra and Bolin look up in surprise. Korra drops the water to the floor.)</i> <br><br><b>Ring Announcer:</b> Your winners, the Wolfbats!<br><b>Korra:</b> What? How is it over already?<br><br><i>(Korra and Bolin get up to go see the arena floor. The Wolfbats all hold their arms up in victory and wave to the crowd.)</i><br><br><b>Radio Broadcaster:</b> With a brutal round one knockout the defending champs secure their spot in the finals. <i>(cut to a shot of the opposing team being pulled from the water. Two are on stretchers. Cut to a closer shot of the waterbender unconscious, and next to his head is his helmet with its visor cracked)</i> I hope the Ferrets know a good doctor because they're gonna need one. <br><br><i>(Cut to and zoom in or Korra, Bolin, and Mako as they look on in shock and fear.)</i><br><br><br><br>[End Credits]<br>

Only one team stands in their way, the Wolfbats. Led by team captain Tahno, the brutal Wolfbats look to repeat as champs.

I hope you all enjoyed last night's probending match, because it will be the last. It's time for this city to stop worshipping bending athletes as if they were heroes. I am calling on the council to shut down the bending arena and cancel the finals. <i>(the three benders look at each other worriedly)</i> Or else, there will be severe consequences.<br><br><i>(There is static, and the transmission goes out.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> That guy's got some nerve.<br><b>Mako:</b> You think the council will give in?<br><b>Korra:</b> I'm not waiting to find out. We need to get to City Hall. <br><br><i>(Korra turns and leaves. Cut to an establishing shot of City Hall as Korra, Mako, and Bolin ride Naga towards it.

Tenzin stands up and we cut to a shot of him.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Korra, you shouldn't be here. This is a closed meeting.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(approaching along with Mako and Bolin)</i> As the Avatar and a probending player, I have a right to be heard. You can't cancel the finals. <br><b>Tenzin:</b> I know winning the championship means a lot to you but as far as I'm concerned, we need to shut the arena down. <br><b>Korra:</b> What about the rest of you? Tarrlok, there's no way you're backing down from Amon, right? <br><b>Tarrlok:</b> <i>(standing up)</i> Actually, Tenzin and I agree for once. <br><b>Tenzin:</b> The council is unanimous. We're closing the arena.<br><b>Mako:</b> No!<br><b>Bolin:</b> You can't!<br><b>Korra:</b> I... I don't understand. I thought <i>you</i> of all people, would take a stand against Amon. <br><b>Tarrlok:</b> While I am still committed to bringing that lunatic to justice, I will not put innocent lives at stake just so you and your friends can play. A game. <br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(passionately)</i> Probending might only be a game to you, but think of what it means to the city. Right now the arena is the one place where benders and non-benders gather together in... in peace. To watch benders-<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(gesturing dramatically)</i> Beat each other up! In peace! It's an inspiration to everyone! <br><b>Tarrlok:</b> I appreciate your naÔve idealism, but you're ignoring the reality of the situation.<br><b>Korra:</b> The reality is, if you close the arena, you let Amon win. <br><b>Bolin:</b> Yes! Exactly what she said. Yes.<br><b>Tarrlok:</b> I'm sorry but our decision has been made. This meeting is adjourned. <br><br><i>(Tarrlok picks up his gavel to strike it down.

Come on, show a little more backbone. It's time that the benders of this city displayed some strength and unity against these Equalists.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> We must prevent the conflict between benders and non-benders from escalating into all out war! <i>(cut to a close up of Tarrlok as he thinks for a second)</i> The council is not changing its position. <br><b>Tarrlok:</b> Now, just a moment, Tenzin. Let us hear what our esteemed Chief of Police has in mind.<br><br><i>(Tenzin huffs, crossing his arms and turning away grumpily)</i><br><br><b>Lin:</b> If you keep the arena open, my metalbenders and I will provide extra security during the championship match. There's no matter force to deal with the chi blockers. Our armor is impervious to their attacks. <br><b>Tarrlok:</b> <i>(smirking)</i> Are you saying that you will <i>personally</i> take responsibility for the safety of the spectators in the arena?<br><b>Lin:</b> I guarantee it.<br><b>Tarrlok:</b> It is hard to argue with Chief Beifong's track record. If she is confident, her elite officers can protect the arena, then she has my support. I am changing my vote. <i>(raises his hand)</i> Who else is with me? <i>(the other three council members raise their hands as well. Tenzin turns away and shakes his head sadly)</i> The arena stays open. Good luck in the finals!<br><b>Bolin:</b> Alright!<br><b>Mako:</b> Yeah!<br><b>Korra:</b> Thank you!<br><b>Tarrlok:</b> <i>(smirking)</i> And... good luck to you, Chief Beifong.<br><br><i>(Cut to a profile shot of Lin.

I want to make sure she's safe.<br><b>Lin:</b> <i>(angry)</i> Do what you want. It's not like I've never been able to stop you before. <br><br><i>(Lin walks past Tenzin to leave. Just then, Korra approaches her with a hand raised in greeting.)</i> <br><br><b>Korra:</b> E...excuse me Chief Beifong, I wanted to thank you for your help. <i>(Lin walks by without even acknowledging Korra)</i> It... really... means a lot... Ugh! What is her deal? Even when she's on my side, she's against me. <br><b>Tenzin:</b> I have known Lin since we were children. She's always been... challenging. <br><b>Korra:</b> What did your father do to make her <i>hate</i> the Avatar so much?<br><b>Tenzin:</b> My father and Lin got along famously. I'm afraid her issues are with me.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>gasp</i> Wait a second, it all makes sense now! You and Beifong, Beifong and you! You two were a couple!<br><b>Tenzin:</b> What?! How... <i>(nervous and checking to see if anyone else is around)</i> Where did you get that idea?!<br><b>Korra:</b> Hah! <i>(smirking)</i> Your wife! <br><b>Tenzin:</b> Criminy. I'll have to have a word with her.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(smug)</i> So... Pema stole you from Beifong. I'm surprised our esteemed Chief of Police didn't throw her in jail.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> Well, she tried. Anyway, Pema didn't steal me, Lin and I have been growing apart for some time. We both had different goals in life- <i>(incredulous)</i> Why am I even telling you this?! It all happened a long time ago and we've moved past it.<br><b>Korra:</b> Hmm... Apparently Beifong hasn't. <br><b>Tenzin:</b> What do you m- Of course she has! Anyway, this is none of your business! <i>(turns and leaves briskly)</i><br><b>Korra:</b> See you at home, Mr. Heartbreaker. <br><br><i>(Korra chuckles as a frowning and embarrassed Tenzin walks away.

At least for one night.<br><br><i>(Lin's face softens as she turns to Tenzin.)</i> <br><br><b>Lin:</b> Like old times? <br><b>Tenzin:</b> Like old times.<br><b>Lin:</b> Okay.

Bolin bows and Pabu does a flip. Bolin then pulls an earth disc from the floor with bending and makes a larger hole in the middle. Pabu does two back flips and jumps through the disc, then jumps back through and lands on his front paw. Bolin raises his arms in triumph.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Yes!

The earthbender pushes Mako back with more discs and pushes him over the line. Cut to an overhead shot of the floor as everyone attacks.

The disc bounces off the ropes and collides with the firebender before he can react in time, sending him tumbling back into the ropes)</i> Shaozu gets fancy but Bolin ricochets a disc off the ropes and says 'No, thank you sir!'<br><br><b>Mako:</b> Nice shot!<br><br><i>(Tahno looks to his teammate as he gets up, then glares at the Fire Ferrets before rushing forward. Tahno blocks an attack by Korra and sends a counter attack with one spinning movement.

That was a hosing foul!<br><br><i>(The referee signals for them to keep playing. Mako glares before getting into his stance, and the teams start battling again.)</i><br><br><b>Radio Broadcaster:</b> And the Wolfbats advance despite Tahno exceeding the waterbending time limit. A questionable call by the officials. <i>(the scene goes into slow motion as the Wolfbat earthbender raises a disc up from under Mako's foot, making him stumble.

Bolin jumps over the sheet of water as the scene goes into slow motion, but the water freezes beneath him, causing him to slip when he lands. The fire blast hits Bolin and he is sent over the edge and into the water)</i> Looks like Tahno snuck in an illegal icing move but once again, there's no call. I don't know what match the refs are watching but it's obviously not this one. <i>(Korra and Mako are left. The earthbender and Tahno both attack Korra and push her over the line, letting them advance)</i> Ooo, a splash-and-clash sends the Avatar to zone three as well. <i>(all three Wolfbats attack at once. Mako steps in front of Korra to defend her, attempting to block with a burst of fire, but the attack is too strong, and Korra and Mako are knocked over the edge)</i> It's a knockout! <i>(Tahno and the Wolfbats begin to wave to the cheering crowd and turn away)</i> The Wolfbats win the championship for the fourth year in a- <i>(cut to a close up of the broadcaster)</i> Hold on a second folks! <i>(cut to a shot of Korra hanging onto the edge of the arena floor with one hand and holding onto Mako by the shirt with the other)</i> Scratch that, the Ferrets are still alive but just barely.<br><br><i>(Cut to a close up of Korra as she grunts and struggles to pull Mako up.

Mako lands on his feet and immediately kicks, sending a fire ball at Tahno while his back is turns and knocking him over the line. The other Wolfbats turn around in shock. Tahno stands back up, looking furious. Mako smirks at Tahno while getting into his battle stance.)</i> <br><br><b>Radio Broadcaster:</b> What an unbelievable move! These Ferrets aren't just bending the elements, they're bending my mind! <i>(zoom in on Tahno's face as he glares at Mako, seething with rage)</i> The underdogs survive to see round two.<br><br><i>(Cut to a shot of the referees standing on their balcony, and tilt down to the Fire Ferrets huddled. The Wolfbats wait on their side of the floor.)</i> <br><br><b>Korra:</b> What's wrong with these refs?! <br><b>Mako:</b> They've been paid off. It's the only explanation. Someone wants us to lose.<br><b>Korra:</b> If the Wolfbats are gonna fight dirty, then so should we. <br><b>Mako:</b> No, we can't! The refs have it out for us. If we're gonna win this thing, it has to be fair and square. <br><b>Korra:</b> Ugh, that's no fun but alright.<br><br><i>(Cut to the announcer as he dramatically raises two fingers into the air.)</i><br><br><b>Ring Announcer:</b> Round two! <br><br><i>(The bell rings and we cut to an overhead shot of the teams facing each other.

Cut to Mako as he weaves and dodges a few fire blasts aimed at his head, throwing one back)</i> Wowza! Those look like illegal head shots to me.<br><br><i>(The scene goes into slow motion as Mako leans backward, barely avoiding a fire blast that passes over his face plate. The bell rings and we cut to a shot of the arena floor, showing players in each zone and making the round a tie.)</i><br><br><b>Ring Announcer:</b> Round two will be decided with a tie-breaker! <br><br><i>(Cut to a close up of a coin held by the referee as he tosses and catches it.

Cut back to Tahno as he easily leans to avoid the attack and goes to counter attack, but the scene goes into slow motion as a blast of water catches him under the chin, knocking his head gear off. The scene quickly reverses and we cut to a shot from the side of the platform to see a replay of what happened, from a different angle. Korra jabs and Tahno avoids, but Korra follows up by kicking water at Tahno just as he is about to attack. Tahno's own attack loses momentum and falls short of Korra as he falls off the platform and to the floor, making the bell ring. Korra taunts Tahno back and smirks like he did.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Hmph. Chump. <br><br><i>(Cut to the Wolfbat fan girls as they frown in disbelief mid cheer.

Both teams begin to battle, throwing their elements and defending attacks)</i> The Wolfbats fly out of the gate, swinging with bad intentions. The challengers are showing a lot of heart but that champs are really starting to find their rhythm now. <i>(the wolfbat earthbender kicks a disc before the firebender does a barrel roll over his back and sends an arc of fire out with a spinning downward kick. Tahno does a back flip off one of the ring posts to avoid one of Bolin's discs and counters by swinging his arm down and throwing an arc of water when he lands. The earthbender does a somersault, popping a disc up when he lands on his feet and then sending it flying with a spinning crescent kick)</i> Can the Ferrets hang in there with the best? Especially when the best are frankly getting a little help from the refs? <i>(Korra blocks the earth disc with her body, then follows up by turning around and bending some water at Tahno, who smirks and blocks it with his shoulder as the scene goes into slow motion for a moment)</i> It's all down to this final round! <i>(cut to Mako as he does a punch combo, sending out several fireballs)</i> Mako is giving it all in the ring but it looks like Tahno and Ming are up to more shenanigans! <i>(cut to Tahno and the earthbender Wolfbat as the earthbender does a spinning kick to send a disc flying. He stands in front of Tahno as he pops up another disc and holds it behind him. Cut to a close up of the disc being held behind the earthbender as he crushes it into several large pieces. Tahno envelops the rocks in water, and proceeds to spin around to the front, swinging his arms and throwing three streams of water filled with rocks. The attacks hit Mako and Bolin, knocking them over the edge of the ring. The camera zooms in on Korra as the third stream of water hits her in the face. The scene goes into slow motion, and we see the chunks of the shattered earth disc travel up the stream and collide with Korra's head, knocking her back and sending her rolling over the edge. Cut to a shot from below the water's surface as each Fire Ferret plunges into it)</i> Oh this has gone too far!

Mako, Bolin, and Korra look to him. Cut to a shot of Korra as she gasps, then cut to the Lieutenant as he raises his electrified kali sticks, charging them up. The camera zooms out as he plunges them into the water just as Korra throws a stream of water at him. She is too late, and the three benders are electrified before the attack reaches, crying out in pain before passing out. Cut to the broadcaster in his booth. The sounds of people screaming and sparks flying are heard.)</i><br><br><b>Radio Broadcaster:</b> Folks, there is some sort of electrical disturbance in the stands. Metalbender cops are dropping like bumbleflies. There appear to be masked members of the audience wielding strange devices on their hands. <i>(the door behind him opens and the camera zooms out to show an Equalist entering the booth)</i> One of them is in the booth with me right now, folks. <i>(the Equalist raises his gloved hand, and the center circle glows blue as it charges)</i> He is leveling one of those gloved devices at me now and I believe he is about to electrocute me. I am currently wetting my pants!<br><br><i>(Cut to a close up of the Equalist's gloved palm as he flexes his fingers and electricity flies from the center. Cut to the Wolfbats looking on with fright at the ensuing attack. Cut to a shot from behind them as we see the center platform rise up with Amon and six chi blockers.

Cut to a shot of Tenzin on the floor while Equalists stand nearby, holding the spectators hostage with their taser gloves. Cut to a shot of the arena's ring, with Amon and the chi blockers in the foreground and Tahno and the Wolfbats standing in front of them. Cut to a shot from the side of Tahno as he looks up to the referee and backs away slowly.)</i> <br><br><b>Tahno:</b> What's going on here, ref?<br><b>Referee:</b> I don't know!<br><br><i>(Cut to an overhead shot as Amon and the chi blockers approach and the Wolfbats back away. Cut to Tahno who seems hesitant at first before standing his ground.)</i><br><br><b>Tahno:</b> Alright, you want a piece of the Wolfbats? Here it comes! <br><br><i>(Tahno takes his stance and bends a stream of water at Amon. The camera cuts to and quickly zooms in on Amon as he easily leans out of the way of the water whip. Amon moves side to side and lunges forward. Cut to Tahno and the earthbender as they throw out attacks. Tahno swings his arms in a circular motion downward, creating a circular arc of water as Amon gets close, but Amon spins to the side. The firebender punches at Amon and shoots a blast of fire at him, but Amon weaves to the side to avoid. The firebender readies another attack, but Amon closes the distance and pushes his arm to the side, gets behind him and puts him in an arm lock. The firebender yells in fright as Amon spins him around and throws him. Cut to Tahno as he bends two streams of water. He is about to attack with them when his wrists are caught and bound by a bolo thrown by a chi blocker. The camera tilts up to show the earthbender Wolfbat stumbling back as his wrists are also caught by a bolo. A chi blocker flings a bolo at the earthbenders legs, catching them and making him fall down. Cut to a wider shot of the Wolfbats incapacitated, and Amon and his chi blockers standing over them. Tahno is on his knees in front of Amon, his arms held by two chi blockers. Cut to a close up of a terrified Tahno.)</i><br><br><b>Tahno:</b> Wait, <i>please</i> don't do this! I'll give you the championship pot, I... I'll give you everything just please don't take my bending!<br><br><i>(Cut to a shot from Tahno's point of view as Amon raises his hand above him, the spot light shining behind Amon, and brings his hand towards the camera. Cut to a close up of Tahno's horrified face, Amon's thumb placed against his forehead, and zoom in while Tahno's eyes quiver. Cut to a close up of Amon as he looks back up, having taken away Tahno's bending. Cut to a shot of the edge of the ring as the chi blockers drag the now powerless Wolfbats to it and throw them over. The camera follows them as they fall and hit the water. Cut to a shot from below of the upper stands as two Equalists hang a large Equalist banner over the side. Cut to a wide shot of the arena as several more banners are hung. Cut to below the ring as the Lieutenant pulls Korra out of the water and up onto the middle platform, Mako and Bolin still unconscious and set against a nearby post. <br><br>Cut to Korra's perspective as she looks up at the Lieutenant dragging her by the arm, then cut to a shot of her as she groans, too hurt to fight back. She closes her eyes, and suddenly we shift to Korra's vision. We see Aang and Toph in a flash back. Toph is pointing and saying something. There is a flash transition to a close up of Yakone smirking with Aang sitting behind him in City Hall. Transition to a shot from below of Yakone standing up, then transition to Aang in the Avatar State floating above Yakone. Transition to a close up of Aang as his eyes and arrow return back to normal, and his expression determined. <br><br>There is a slower flash, and we return to a shot of the Lieutenant tying the Fire Ferrets to the post with a long bolo. Cut to a close up of a microphone being held by Amon, and tilt up to Amon's face.)</i><br><br><b>Amon:</b> I believe I have your attention, benders of Republic City. So once again, the Wolfbats are your probending champions. It seems fitting that you celebrate three bullies who cheated their way to victory. <i>(points to the audience)</i> Because every day you threaten and abuse your fellow non-bending citizens, just like the Wolfbats did to their opponents tonight. <i>(cut to a shot of Tahno and the Wolfbats climbing out of the water below, exhausted)</i> Those men were supposedly the best in the bending world and yet it only took a few moments for me to cleanse them of their impurity. Let this be a warning to all of you benders out there, if any of you stand in my way, you will meet the same fate. <i>(cut to members of the audience as they gasp. Cut back to Amon, and we see the Lieutenant now standing behind him)</i> Now, to my followers, for years the Equalists have been forced to hide in the shadows but now, we have the numbers and the strength to create a new Republic City! I'm happy to tell you the time for change has finally come.<br><br><i>(Cut to the platform below where Korra, Mako, and Bolin are tied up. Each of them wakes up while Amon is speaking, and we cut to a closer shot of them.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> How are we gonna get out of here?<br><br><i>(Korra and Mako look unsure, while Bolin smiles as he looks to the water. Cut to a shot from behind the three of them to see Pabu swimming towards the platform.

Listen up, buddy.<br><br><i>(Bolin begins to click his teeth while Pabu chirps at him)</i> <br><br><b>Amon:</b>...will be replaced by fair minded Equalist government. You and your children...<br><br><i>(Mako grows impatient while Korra looks on in confusion.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Stop fooling around!<br><b>Bolin:</b> I'm not, I'm trying to save us!<br><br><i>(Cut to a close up of Pabu as he nibbles through the ropes.)</i><br><br><b>Amon:</b> ...will no longer need to walk afraid...<br><br><i>(Cut back to the medium shot of Bolin, Korra, and Mako as Bolin turns and smiles at his friends.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> See? Pabu is not a one trick poodlepony.<br><br><i>(Mako and Korra smile back at Bolin. Cut to a close up of Amon's profile.)</i><br><br><b>Amon:</b> ...It's time to take back our city. For centuries, benders possessed an unnatural advantaged over ordinary people. <i>(cut to a shot from the stands and we see the Equalists standing in front of the spectators with their taser gloves glowing, ready to shock anyone who might attempt to escape)</i> But thankfully, modern technology has provided us with a way to even out the playing field. <i>(Cut to a close up of an Equalist, and zoom out and focus on the glowing palm of their taser glove)</i> Now anyone can hold the power of a chi blocker in their hand. My followers and I will not rest until the entire city achieves equality. And once that goal is achieved, we will equalize the rest of the world. The revolution has begun!<br><br><i>(Amon raises his fist into the air. Cut to a shot of Amon from below, and tilt up to see a zeppelin flying over the arena roof. The glass above shatters as several ropes fall down through it. Cut to a shot of the outside of the arena to see the zeppelin floating above, with the Equalist insignia on it. Cut back to the inside as the ropes lower down to Amon and his Equalists. They each walk to the ropes, which have a mechanism at the end that turns into a platform. The each stand on a platform and are pulled up. Cut to a shot from the stands as the Equalists with the taser gloves run away. Cut Tenzin and Lin lying on the ground as they groan and get back up. Lin crouches next to a still delirious Tenzin.)</i>.<br><br><b>Lin:</b> Tenzin! <br><br><i>(Lin looks up and sees Amon escaping. Lin and Tenzin get to their feet and look worried a moment before an explosion rocks the building. Cut to a shot of the arena ring and zoom out as a large fiery explosion erupts. The explosion replays from two different angles and ends on a shot with Lin shielding her eyes. Cut to Bolin and Pabu below the floor as they see debris fall around them.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> It's okay Pabu, just a little explosion. <i>(clicks his teeth)</i> Keep chewing, you're almost through it. <i>(Pabu chews through more rope and gets the benders loose)</i> Yes! Great job, buddy!<br><br><i>(Korra immediately runs to the water upon being freed. She creates ice over the surface and slides across before looking up to see what is going on.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> I'm going after Amon!<br><b>Mako:</b> Be careful!<br><br><i>(Korra jumps into the water. Cut to a shot below the surface as Korra begins to spin around. Cut to a shot from above the surface as Korra bursts from the water and rises up on a water spout, heading for the hole in the roof. Korra looks determined, but becomes worried when her spout begins to lose power. Eventually, Korra goes too high and the water spout gives out. Korra begins to fall back down.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Ughhh!!!<br><br><i>(Korra reaches upward, and we cut to her perspective as Amon quickly grows more distant. Cut to a close up of a metal cable flying through the air. it wraps around Korra's waist and catches her.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(gasp)</i> Ahhh!!!<br><br><i>(Cut to a shot of Lin swinging through the air on one cable as she holds Korra with the other. Korra rights herself up and grabs on. Lin swings around to get into position before flinging Korra back up to the roof. Cut to a shot from above as Korra rockets upward. Cut to the outside of the roof where Amon and his followers are still being pulled up to the zeppelin, now with Korra gaining on them. Cut to a shot of the Lieutenant and a chi blocker standing on the platform and hanging on to the rope. Korra rises up from behind them and delivers a fire blast from a flying roundhouse kick, knocking him off before grabbing onto the rope before kicking the chi blocker off with another fiery kick. Korra steadies herself and looks up. Cut to a shot of Amon looking down at Korra as he continues to be pulled up. Cut back to Korra, who glares and punches up at Amon, shooting a very powerful ball of fire at him. Cut to the inside of the zeppelin as Amon steps off the platform just before the fire reaches inside, just avoiding the attack. Amon is unfazed as the blast knocks back the surrounding chi blockers. Korra continues to shoot fire up into the zeppelin while Amon merely looks down, fire flying all around him before turning away.<br><br>Cut back to Korra frowning and looking up, her hair blowing in the wind. She looks back down and takes an expression of shock and worry. The camera zooms very far back to show the arena and the surrounding bay. The patrol boats and police zeppelins are all on fire. Cut to the hole in the roof as Lin jumps up through it, landing and retracting her cables before shooting one up at a chi blocker that was swinging towards Korra, snaring him. Lin swings the cable down and slams the chi blocker into the roof below. Two more chi blockers slide down Korra's rope and knock her off. Cut to a shot from below as Korra lands, cracking the glass. The rope and platform are pulled back up, and Lin grapple it with a cable. Before she can pull herself up, the Lieutenant rushes towards her, striking her with his electrified rods and knocking her down, causing her to let go of the rope and platform.<br><br>The three chi blockers rush towards the fallen Lin, but a fire blast knocks one down as Korra chases after them. The chi blocker that was hit rolls and gets on his hands and knees, but Korra steps on him and knocks him out as she jumps off of him. Korra shoots two more blasts of fire at the remaining chi blockers with a punch and spinning axe kick while in the air, she does another spin in the air and fire envelops her foot. Cut to the Lieutenant as he is about to strike Lin, spinning towards her and ready to swing his electrified rods down. He is struck by a fire blast from Korra from the side just before he can land his attack. The Lieutenant rolls and gets back on his feet as Korra does a side kick, sending a stream of flame at him. The Lieutenant jumps and rolls out of the way, and runs to the side when Korra shoots more fire at him. Korra chases after him, and he turns around once she's close to strike her. Korra does a back flip to avoid the Lieutenant's attack. She lands in a hand stand, pulls her legs back, then swings them down heel first as the Lieutenant rushes in for another strike, sending out a wave of fire, but the Lieutenant jumps over it.<br><br>Korra and the Lieutenant continue to battle each other, dodging and striking back with fire and electricity. Two chi blockers regain consciousness and run past Lin to join the Lieutenant, but Lin gets up and fire her cables, wrapping them around the chi blockers and then flinging them to either side. Lin gets back on her feet, spinning around on her hands and whipping her cables around her as she does so before retracting them. She looks back up to the zeppelin as it starts floating away. Lin flings a cable at it one more time and catches one of the hanging platforms. She starts reeling the cable in, pulling herself up to the zeppelin.<br><br>There's a flash of electricity and we cut to Korra fighting the Lieutenant. She jumps back and the Lieutenant rushes at her, attacking with a downward swing with both sticks before stabbing at Korra. Korra dodges the attacks, grabs his arm and hits the Lieutenant in the chest with her knee, using the momentum to throw him down, cracking the roof. Korra follows up with a fiery axe kick, but the Lieutenant rolls to a crouch and deflects Korra's foot with his stick. He follows up with a reverse hook kick, Korra avoids it and counters with a punch-punch-kick combo, shooting out more fire. The Lieutenant dodges all of them, ducking under the roundhouse kick. The scene goes into slow motion as the Lieutenant's stick charges for an attack, and we cut to a close up of him as he swings his stick down. Cut to Korra as she ducks and spins out of the way, turning around and striking with her elbow. She hits the Lieutenant, knocking him back and forcing him to his knee. The Lieutenant gets back up, but Korra runs at him. She jumps and spins in the air, delivering two waves of fire from a whirlwind kick followed by an aerial axe kick. The camera zoom out as the Lieutenant is knocked over the side of the roof and goes rolling down.<br><br>Korra lands, but there's a cracking sound. She gasps when the glass beneath her breaks, and we cut to an overhead shot as she goes plummeting. The camera zooms out to show Lin looking down from above. Cut to Lin with a worried expression. She looks back up at the zeppelin, and then bends her cables to let go of it. Lin begins to fall, and shoots her cables down at the hole Korra fell through, attaching four cables to the edges and then reeling them in to make herself fall faster. Cut to Korra falling through the air and into the smoke cloud from the explosion, then to Lin as she shoots a cable to the side, latching it to an Equalist banner. Lin shoots another cable down at Korra, and we cut to Korra and zoom in through the smoke as the cable reaches her and she catches it with her hand. Lin swings out of the smoke along with Korra towards the stands, tearing the banner. Lin lands on her feet and retracts her cables while Korra rolls to her hands and knees. Lin runs over and helps Korra back up.)</i><br><br><b>Lin:</b> You alright? <br><b>Korra:</b> I'm fine, thanks to you.<br><b>Lin:</b> Don't mention it, kid. <i>(they look up at the hole in the roof and see the zeppelin flying away)</i> Looks like we lost this one.<br><br><i>(Cut to a shot of Mako and Bolin with Pabu jogging up to Korra. Mako gives Korra a hug.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> I'm so glad you're okay! <br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(giving them both a hug)</i> Me too!<br><br><i>(The camera pans left as Tenzin walks up to Lin and puts a hand on her shoulder.)</i><br><br><b>Lin:</b> I can't believe Amon did this. I played right into his hand. <br><b>Tenzin:</b> He played us all. Republic City is at war.<br><br><i>(Cut to a shot from behind the group and then tilt up towards the smoking ring in the center of the arena, then up to the hole in the glass roof as the moon shines through it.)</i><br><br><br><br>[End Credits]<br>

These revolutionaries who call themselves "Equalists" are not interested in equality at all. They just want to wage war against benders. Chief Bei Fong was supposed to protect Republic City, but she was powerless to stop Amon's attack on the arena. She has failed us all. If we are to survive these dire times, our law enforcement needs new leadership.<br><br><br><br><u><b>Act I</b></u><br><br><i>(The scene opens with an overhead view of the Pro-Bending Arena building. The glass dome is broken in places, and construction scaffolding is in place around it. Some cars are parked near the entrance, which is blocked off by a police barricade. The view shifts to show Korra riding Naga up the path to the entrance, with some Metalbender police milling around in the background. The polarbear-dog comes to stop just before a line of police tape, and Korra immediately hops off and yanks the tape up to duck under it.<br><br>The scene changes to Mako and Bolin's attic apartment.

In the foreground are a cluster of lizard crows picking food off the ground, and in the distance behind them is a dingy warehouse. The lizard crows are disturbed by the sound of an approaching vehicle, and take off just before a police truck can run over them as it speeds toward the warehouse. It busts through the building's door as the view shifts to the interior, and Metalbenders break through the warehouse's windows and repel down to the ground. Additional forces come out of the truck. The Metalbenders stream through the building and pull tarps off of abandoned machinery. One of them finds a table stacked with flyers bearing Amon's image. Another opens a crate to find it filled with the same electric gloves used to assault the Pro-Bending Arena. The view shifts to show Chief Ling Bei Fong overseeing the raid.)</i><br><br><b>Lin:</b> Looks like our intel was good.<br><b>Saikhan:</b> There's enough evidence here to bury Cabbage Corp for an eternity.<br><br><i>(The scene shifts to pan down over a tall building with a gold rooftops. A small crowd is gathering at the entrance. The camera zooms in past a statue of a historic Cabbage Merchant standing next to a cart full of his product, holding a head of cabbage aloft with triumph.)</i><br><br><b>Lau:</b> <i>(being led out the building's entrance by Saikhan, with Lin following closely.)</i> This is an outrage, I'm innocent!<br><b>Saikhan:</b> Yeah, yeah.

I know we're not exactly "best friends," but I'm sorry Amon took your bending.<br><b>Tahno:</b> I've been to the best healers in the city. Whatever Amon did to me, it's permanent. <i>(becomes intense)</i> You gotta get him for me.<br><br><i>(Korra nods, her face hard.

The camera flies up past the front gate and follows the path uphill, past various buildings, to the main mansion at the highest point. The scene cuts inside to a Lionturtle statue with a waterfall pouring out of its carved mouth. Pabu squeals and takes a flying leap off the statue's head to dive into the large pool. The view shifts to show the whole room, decorated luxuriously with carved golden walls, lawn furniture, and potted plants. Bolin is poised to dive off the statue's head, and on the opposite side of the pool Asami is sitting at the edge dipping her feet while Mako stands in the water beside her.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Earthbending bomb! <i>(He jumps into the pool, splashing the others, as a butler enters the room leading a gawking Korra.)</i><br><b>Butler:</b> Avatar Korra has arrived.<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(waves)</i> Hey, Korra.<br><b>Asami:</b> Glad you made it.<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(emerges from the water with a splash)</i> Welcome to paradise. <i>(sinks down to float on his back with Pabu perched on top of him)</i><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(sits down on a lounge chair, speaking with bemusement)</i> Looks like you guys settled right in.<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(wading)</i> Pretty much, except someone forgot to ask her father if we could stay here.<br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(wading beside Mako)</i> Yeah, but I smoothed it over with him. It's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(emerges from the water beside Korra, dripping, with Pabu on his head)</i> This is the greatest place in the world.

As soon as the towel is taken away, Pabu's fur puffs out. Bolin grins and jumps back into the water. The Butler slumps with annoyance, a vein comically popping in his forehead.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(to Asami as she wades close)</i> So, what do you have planned for us today? <i>(false, weary cheer)</i> Let me guess: shopping, makeovers?<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(pushes Mako under the water, and turns to raise his hand)</i> Ooh, Ooh! I vote makeovers! <i>(Mako pops back up and shoves Bolin underwater in retaliation.)</i><br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(emerging from the pool)</i> I have something a little more exciting in mind.<br><br><i>(The scene cuts to a professional driving course, where two racing Satomobiles jockey for the lead. The camera follows them as they pass the finish line, revealing Korra and friends watching from the stands.)</i><br><br><b>Asasmi:</b> Pretty cool, huh?<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(smiling)</i> Way cooler than a makeover.<br><b>Asami:</b> This is where Future Industries test drives their Satomobiles.

A helmeted Korra and Asami are in one, with the latter in the driver's seat. Asami looks over at her opponent, and he smirks back. A referee waves the white starting flag, and both cars take off past him. The challenger, driving the red car, cuts Asami's gold car off on a turn they both take in a skid. They hit a straightaway as Asami smirks and guns the engine, passing her opponent. The view jumps over to show Mako and Bolin cheering in the stands.)</i><br><br><b>Mako and Bolin:</b> Yeah!<br><b>Bolin:</b> Woohoo!<br><br><i>(Back on the racetrack, Asami is once again in second place. She gains on her opponent, but he notices and moves his car to block her. Asami's eyes narrow. She shifts gears and works the pedals to get more speed out of her vehicle. The car moves closer to the track's inside and creeps up. The wheels scrape up against the road's border, sending up sparks and smoke, but it continues to overtake the red car. Korra looks at the scraping wheel with concern, then over at the other driver as she passes him. He guns his car forward, but his front wheel collides with the gold car's rear wheel, pushing the red car off balance and into a spin. The challenger falls behind as the gold car continues onward. Korra looks back at the spinning red car, then forward at Asami with a big grin. Their car crosses the finish line, followed shortly by the still-spinning red car. Asami smiles and pulls into the pit.<br><br>Once the car comes to a stop, Korra hops out. Asami emerges more slowly, taking off her helmet.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> That was amazing! I didn't think we'd make it.<br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(fluffing her hair)</i> Well, you can't be afraid to mix it up sometimes.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(removes helmet)</i> I gotta admit I had you pegged wrong. I thought you were kind of prissy. <i>(concerned)</i> No offense.<br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(laughs)</i> It's all right. People usually assume that I'm daddy's helpless little girl, but I can handle myself. I mean, I've been in self defense classes since I was this high. <i>(motions indicating half her current height)</i> My dad made sure I would always be able to protect myself.<br><b>Korra:</b> Smart guy.<br><br><i>(Back at the mansion, the butler opens the door to find the group returned from the racetrack. Bolin is doing the 'potty dance' while Mako is slapping his forehead in embarrassment.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Emergency! Emergency, coming through! Beep, beep! <i>(runs deeper into the mansion leaving a smoke trail)</i><br><b>Korra:</b> Uh, is there another bathroom I can use?<br><b>Asami:</b> We have a ladies' powder room upstairs. First door on your right. <i>(Mako steps behind Asami and puts a hand on her shoulder.)</i> You can freshen up in there.<br><b>Korra:</b> Thanks.<br><br><i>(The scene cuts to Korra washing her hands in the sink. She shuts off the water and dries with the towel, then notices a powder puff beside the sink. With trepidation, she lifts the puff by its handle, and raises it to her face. She hesitates, gazing at the unfamiliar instrument, then shuts her eyes and roughly slams the puff onto her face. A cloud of powder explodes outward to completely hide her whole upper body, sending Korra into a coughing fit. She emerges from the bathroom still coughing and waving floating powder from her face. As she walks away, she overhears Hiroshi's muffled voice coming from behind a closed door.)</i><br><br><b>Hiroshi:</b> <i>(voice over, muted)</i> No, no, I assure you. Everything is going exactly as planned. <i>(Korra's face hardens, and she looks around to make sure no one is watching before she sneaks to the door to peak through the keyhole.)</i> Mhhm, yes. Luckily the Cabbage Corp investigation has bought us enough time. <i>(Through the keyhole, she sees Hiroshi sitting at his desk with his back turned towards the door.)</i> Trust me. By the end of the week, we'll be ready to strike.<br><br><i>(Hiroshi slams the handset down on the phone, and Korra jumps up with alarm. She visibly struggles with her thoughts before running back down the hall.<br><br>In the main hall, Mako and Asami are watching as Bolin poses for the butler, who is squirting perform at Bolin. Korra runs past without even looking at them.)</i><br><br><b>Asasmi:</b> You're leaving? But I-I thought-<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(turns around as she continues to walk towards the door)</i> Sorry, I forgot I'm supposed to airsit, I mean babybend, I-I mean babysit the airbender kids. See you later.<br><br><i>(She dashes out the door, and the others are left to stare in surprise. Fade to commercial break.)</i><br><br><br><br><b><u>Act II</u></b><br><br><i>(It is night in Republic City. Spotlight traverse the sky, and a Metalbender airship floats lazily above the city. The camera pans down to show Korra, Tenzin, and Lin having a conversation beneath the city's skyscrapers.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> So you think Mr. Sato manufactured those gloves for the Equalists, then framed Cabbage Corp?<br><b>Lin:</b> That's a bold accusation, but what proof do you have?<br><b>Korra:</b> Well I don't exactly have proof, but I know what I heard. Sato's up to something.<br><b>Lin:</b> He does have the means... and he has a motive.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> That's right.<br><b>Korra:</b> A motive? What is it?<br><b>Tenzin:</b> Twelve years ago, the Agni Kai Triad robbed Sato's mansion. <i>(sad)</i> A firebender killed Sato's wife during the break-in.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(sorrowful)</i> That's terrible.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> It was tragic. It's possible he's been harboring anti-bending sentiment all this time.<br><b>Lin:</b> Maybe we should look at Mr. Sato a little more closely.<br><br><i>(The view is filled by a close up of the doors to the Sato mansion. They are opened by the butler, whose eyes widen and face falls at the sight of the off-screen visitors. Mako and Asami are glimpsed coming down the stairs in the background when the view cuts to show Lin, Tenzin, and Korra walking in with determination. The trio passes Mako and Asami on the staircase's first landing. Surprised, Mako grabs Korra by the shoulder.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> What's going on? Why are they asking Hiroshi more questions?<br><b>Korra:</b> I overheard him on the phone yesterday. Asami, I don't know how to tell you this, but I think your father might be involved with the Equalists.<br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(outraged)</i> What? I don't believe this. <i>(walks off to follow Lin and Tenzin)</i><br><b>Mako:</b> You spied on Hiroshi? What's your problem?<br><br><i>(Mako stalks up the stairs, leaving Korra by herself. She looks down with disapointment.<br><br>The scene cuts to Hiroshi's office. He is sitting at his desk in the foreground, his back to the camera. Lin and Tenzin are standing side-by-side.)</i><br><br><b>Lin:</b> Mr. Sato, we just have a few follow-up questions for you.<br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(barging in through the door and walking around to Hiroshi's side)</i> My father is innocent. Just because we're not benders doesn't mean we support those awful Equalists!<br><b>Hiroshi:</b> <i>(surprised)</i> Equalists? Is that what this is about? I can assure you I have nothing to do with those radicals.<br><b>Mako:</b> Yeah, you don't know what you're talking about, Korra.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(gives Mako a defiant look, then turns to face and point at Hiroshi)</i> I overheard you on the phone. You said the Cabbage Corp investigation bought you time and you're getting ready to strike. Explain that.<br><b>Hiroshi:</b> <i>(laughs heartily)</i> This is all just a misunderstanding. Resulting from the young Avatar's overactive imagination. My number one competitor was knocked out of the game. It's providing me an opportunity to strike the market with a new line of Satomobiles. It's just business, nothing nefarious.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(sharing a look with Lin)</i> In order to put all suspicions to rest, might we have a look into your factories and warehouses?<br><br><i>(Asami gives a loud, angry sigh, and looks like she's about to speak, but Hiroshi holds up a hand to settle her.)</i><br><br><b>Hiroshi:</b> If you feel it's necessary, you're welcome to search all of Future Industries.<br><br><i>(The scene changes to the unique-looking Future Industries factory. It has four smokestacks, one at each corner of the building. Two Metalbender airships are hovering in the sky around the factory.)</i><br><br><b>Broadcaster:</b> (voice over) Is it possible presidents of Cabbage Corp and Future Industries both have Equalist ties? <i>(The view goes inside to the factory's loading bay. Trucks and forklifts are scattered about, while Metalbenders search through stacks of boxes. Korra has Naga sniffing around.)</i> Or did Hiroshi Sato frame his long time rival, Lau Gan-Lan? Or did Chief Bei Fong just plain arrest the wrong man? <i>(Link breaks open a crate with the metal wire whips built into her armor.)</i> So far the investigation has yielded no evidence to incriminate Sato. <i>(Throughout the factory, Metalbenders are breaking open crates with their whips and searching the contents.)</i><br><br><i>(The scene cuts to outside the factory. One of the airships has come down out of the twilight sky to hover right next to the building. Lin and Tenzin watch as the police using their grappling whips to ascend into the airship's bay. Korra comes from off-camera riding Naga and approaches her mentors. She leaps down to talk to them.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> I can't believe we didn't find anything.<br><b>Lin:</b> It would appear Hiroshi is innocent.<br><br><i>(Asami and Mako walk over from off-camera, and Asami puts her hands on her hips as she confronts the others.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(hostile)</i> Okay. You did your search. Now you can all leave.<br><br><i>(Lin stares Asami down and grunts, not going anywhere. Mako catches Korra's gaze and steps off to the side. She follows him to where they can converse apart from the others. Asami and Lin watch them from the background.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> So, I hope you're convinced now.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(angry)</i> No, I'm not. I don't care how cooperative Hiroshi is being, I know he's lying.<br><b>Mako:</b> Why are you doing this? <i>(points)</i> Are you that jealous of me and Asami?<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(Korra gasps loudly and leans forward with clenched fists)</i> What? Don't be ridiculous. That has nothing to do with it.<br><b>Mako:</b> If you don't drop this, consider our friendship over.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(stares at Mako, then closes her eyes and looks down)</i> I'm sorry. <i>(opens her eyes)</i> Hiroshi is not the man you think he is.<br><br><i>(Mako just grunts, then walks away to join Asami. She glares at Korra even as Mako puts an arm around her and leads her away. Korra closes her eyes again and sighs before walking off in the opposite direction.<br><br>In the background, a man is pulling the factory's large door closed. The view cuts close to this worker, and he turns around to look at Korra with intense eyes. He heads in her general direction, unnoticed by anyone. Tenzin and Lin are still nearby, and Korra is petting Naga. The worker purposefully walks right past Korra, not quite looking at her, and discreetly puts a folded piece of paper in her free hand as he goes past. Korra's fingers tighten around it reflexively, and her eyes go wide with surprise. She quickly brings the paper up to examine it, then looks around to see where it might have come from. She catches sight of the worker as he boards a truck, surrounded by several of his fellows in identical uniforms. One waves as the truck drives off.<br><br>Korra opens the paper and reads it, then quickly turns to Tenzin and offers him the note.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> I think you guys should hear this. <i>(reading off the paper)</i> "If you want to find the truth, meet me under the north end of the Silk Road Bridge at midnight."<br><br><i>(The scene cuts to the Silk Road Bridge at the appointed hour. A crescent moon is almost fully obscured by clouds, and another Metalbender airship patrols the skies just above. The view pans down reveal Korra, Tenzin, and Lin walking beneath the metal structure. They stop when they hear a low hiss.)</i><br><br><b>Worker:</b> Psst! Over here. <i>(steps out from behind a metal strut as the others approach)</i> Listen. I joined the Equalists because I believed in what Amon said. <i>(fixes the collar of his jacket so that it rises and obscures his face from view)</i> I thought he could make life better for us non-benders. But I didn't sign up for this, this war.<br><b>Lin:</b> What do you have on Hiroshi Sato?<br><b>Worker:</b> He manufactured those gloves for the Equalists.<br><b>Korra:</b> I knew it.<br><b>Worker:</b> And there are rumors he's working on something even bigger. Some new kind of weapon.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> We searched all of Future Industries and found nothing.<br><b>Worker:</b> That's because he has a secret factory.<br><b>Korra:</b> Where?<br><b>Worker:</b> It's right underneath the Sato mansion.<br><br><i>(Korra, Tenzin, and Lin's eyes all go wide, and the Avatar gasps. Fade to commercial break.)</i><br><br><br><br><b><u>Act III</u></b><br><br><i>(The view shows Republic City at night, lit up with golden light from its many tall buildings. A Metalbender airship is flying across the sky above. Within, Korra is crouched against the airship's wall. She takes a deep breath and exhales, then looks to her right where Tenzin and Lin are staring down at the city from the observation deck.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Raiding the Sato mansion is a risky move with Tarrlok breathing down your neck. If we're wrong-<br><b>Lin:</b> I know. I can kiss my job goodbye. But protecting Republic City is all I care about. We can't let Amon get his hands on this new weapon.<br><br><i>(An exterior shot shows the airshp arriving at the Sato estate. The towers and buildings are all lit. The view cuts to a room in the mansion, where Bolin, Mako and Asami are all sitting in chairs and relaxing. Sculptures line the back wall, and the low table in front of the trio boasts a phonograph and a large tray of fruit for Bolin. He has Pabu on his shoulder and lowers a bunch of grapes into his mouth, while Asami leans over to Mako and shows him a record sleeve.<br><br>Suddenly, the doors burst open and a team of Metalbenders rush in, all of them in ready Bending stances. They fan out across the room, followed by Lin and Tenzin.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(outraged)</i> What are you doing here? <i>(The phonograph abruptly cuts out.)</i><br><b>Lin:</b> We have reason to believe there is a factory hidden beneath the mansion.<br><b>Asami:</b> I think I would have noticed if there were a factory underneath my house! <i>(softer, looking away)</i> The lies you people come up with just to persecute my father.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> Where is your father?<br><b>Asami:</b> In his workshop, behind the house.<br><br><i>(The scene moves to the exterior of the workshop. The Metalbenders are approaching slowly, covering each other's backs and spreading their line of vision out across the large grassy yard. The view cuts inside just as the Metalbenders burst through the door and move through the workshop. Plenty of junk and tools are lying around, but the center of the room is empty. Tenzin leads the others into the shop.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(calling out)</i> Dad? Hello?<br><b>Officer:</b> Chief, the estate's been secured. No one has left the workshop since we arrived.<br><b>Lin:</b> Perhaps we just couldn't see him leaving. <i>(Lin ambles out into the center of the room, her hands clasped behind her back. She stops, turns around, then abruptly raises her leg tight against her body. The bottom of her metal boot retracts, revealing the bare foot within, then she stomps down on the floor. The view goes completely black, but is quickly lit up white shockwaves that travel out from Lin's foot and pass over everything in the room. It is exactly like Toph's old tremor-sense. As color returns and the view goes back to normal, Lin straightens from her stance.)</i> There's a tunnel beneath the workshop, running deep into the mountain side.<br><b>Asami:</b> What? <i>(annoyed)</i> There's no tunnel.<br><br><i>(Lin looks down at the empty patch of floor, then takes an Earthbending stances and rips a metal square out of the floor with a wave of both arms. The entire group approaches the whole and looks down. The camera pans out to reveal a braced, dark tunnel with an industrial elevator just below a flight of metal stairs. Asami looks crushed, Mako's eyebrows are raised, Korra simply stares grimly, and Bolin has a hesitant expression.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(whispering to Asami, from behind a hand.)</i> Do you think your dad knows about this tunnel?<br><b>Asami:</b> I don't understand. There must be an explanation<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(gently)</i> Maybe you don't know everything about your father. I'm sorry.<br><b>Lin:</b> Officers, into the tunnel. Be cautious. <i>(They snap from attention and file down the stairs, leaving Mako, Bolin, and Asami behind. The teens move to follow, but Lin's voice stops them.)</i> Uh-uh. You three stay up here. Officer Song, keep an eye on them.<br><br><i>(Officer Song salutes while Lin goes to follow the other Metalbenders. Korra looks back at her friends, Mako front and center, as she and Tenzin follow Lin. Mako cannot hold her gaze, and looks to the side with a chagrined expression.<br><br>The scene cuts to the large elevator platform, as it follows a rail down the diagonally descending tunnel. The only light is a spotlight at the front of the elevator, and red emergency lighting throughout the shaft. Korra is leaning against a railing in the foreground, looking around. After a short ride, the elevator comes to a halt against a perpendicular walkway that leads off screen. The Metalbenders quickly follow it, moving in Bending stances.<br><br>They emerge into a brightly lit, massive room covered in crisscrossed metal bracing. Near the entrance, two massive banners bearing Amon's face hang from a rafter.)</i><br><br><b>Lin:</b> Not your average backyard workshop.<br><br><i>(The view cuts over to show a line of machines parked up against a wall. Superficially human, they stand on legs that end in tank treads, boast a pair of massive clawed arms, and have bulbous heads that resemble first-generation diving helmets with large glass view-ports. The view shifts back to Korra and company, revealing more of the 'mechatanks' behind them.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> And I'm guessing those are the new weapons.<br><br><i>(The camera zooms in on one of the mechatanks, traveling over its metal skin and showing where the plates have been bolted together as armor. The view travels up and over the 'head,' turning around to show the group standing below at what seems like a significant vertical distance. The Metalbenders move to form a circle around Tenzin, Lin, and Korra.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Hiroshi was lying all right, but where is he?<br><br><i>(Suddenly, a metal wall pops up from the floor behind them and completely cuts off the whole end of the room with the exit. Most of the lights go out, plunging the room into shadows.<br><br>Back in the workshop, Asami, Mako, and Bolin are staring down into the tunnel and hear the sound of the wall clamping shut.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> What was that?<br><b>Mako:</b> We need to get down there and see what's going on.<br><b>Song:</b> Absolutely not. You're staying put until the chief comes back.<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(looking at Bolin, who nods back and adopts an artificially nonchalant expression)</i> All right, we'll stay put. But can we wait outside or something? It's so dusty in this workshop. <i>(rubs nose, almost smiling)</i><br><b>Song:</b> No. We're waiting right here.<br><br><i>(Bolin casually rubs a foot against the floor.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Okay, but don't blame me if I start snee... if I start snee... if I start...<br><b>Song:</b> What's your problem, bub?<br><b>Mako:</b> I'm about to-<br><br><i>(Mako leans back as if to sneeze, then throws himself forward and spits out a massive flare of fire that sets Officer Song stumbling backwards. Bolin raises his foot, causing a small square pillar to pop out of the ground just behind Song. The Metalbender trips and flips to fall on his stomach, and Bolin quickly rushes over and leaps into a body-slam right on top of Song. Mako quickly comes over and helps Bolin pin Song down.<br><br>Cut to Office Song tied up to a barrel in the workshop and gagged. His hat is on the ground next to him. The view switches around to show Mako standing up, Bolin and Asami behind him.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Sorry, pal. We know you were just doing your job.<br><b>Bolin:</b> Yeah. <i>(mocking)</i> Just stay put until the chief come back. <i>(quickly)</i> That sounds very familiar, doesn't it? Why? Because you said it.<br><br><i>(The trio approaches the tunnel. Mako puts his hands on Asami's shoulders and stops her from continuing forward. Bolin continues on.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Asami, you should stay here. We'll check it out.<br><b>Asami:</b> I have to find out the truth about my father.<br><b>Mako:</b> I understand. That's why I'm going down; to find out for you. Please.<br><b>Asami:</b> All right. <i>(Mako heads down the tunnel stairs.)</i> Be careful.<br><br><i>(Mako turns back, sharing a last look with Asami.<br><br>Back in the secret factory, Lin rushes at the trapping wall and tries a Bending move to raise it. The wall doesn't respond.)</i><br><br><b>Hiroshi:</b> <i>(intercom voice over)</i> I'm afraid you won't be able to metalbend that wall, Chief Bei Fong. <i>(Sickly green spotlights start flipping on, causing the captives to flinch under the glare. The lights are shown to be coming from the mechatanks, which are powering on.)</i> It's solid platinum. My mechatanks are platinum as well. <i>(A group of the mechatanks drive over and form a half-circle around the Benders. The view cuts to Hirshi himself, in the cockpit of one of the mechatanks. he is clutching a steering lever in each hand.)</i> Not even your renowned mother could bend a metal so pure.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(echoing from the other side of the mechatank's view-port)</i> Hiroshi, I knew you were a lying. no-good Equalist. Come out here and-<br><b>Hiroshi:</b> And do what, young Avatar? Face the wrath of your bending? No. I think I'll from inside here, where my odds are a little more... equal. <i>(The camera zooms out, passing through the view-port to settle below the Benders.)</i><br><b>Lin:</b> That source was a set-up. You lured us down here.<br><b>Hiroshi:</b> Guilty as charged.<br><br><i>(Hiroshi pushes one of the control levers, and his mechatank shoots out a grappling claw. Lin, Tenzin, and Korra all jump out of the way. The other mechatanks move in. One smashes a claw down toward a group of Metalbenders, but they dodge and shoot out their whips to entangle the mechatank. Two other Metalbenders tangle up another of the vehicles, while Lin dodges another grappling hook attack and leaps up into the air above it. As she arcs through the air, she deploys large metal wrist blades out of her armor. As she lands on the mechatank, she punches at the cockpit's main window and drives the blade in as far as it will reach. The view cuts inside the cockpit, where a masked Equalist shifts out of the way of the blade. More blade attacks burst in through the various windows, keeping the driver from doing anything but twisting around in fright. Back outside the cockpit, Lin continues to stab away as the mechatank rolls backwards into some scaffolding.<br><br>The view zooms out from the dusty crash and through the side window of Hiroshi's cockpit. A burst of exterior fire lights the cockpit up with orange glow, and then the view cuts to show Korra Firebending at the mechatank. The humanoid vehicle rolls forward with hesitation, but then is pushed back by a burst of air that comes from over Korra's shoulder. The view cuts to show Tenzin in an Airbending stance, while Metalbenders are still wrangling mechatanks in the background. Tenzin moves towards Korra and off screen, each step carrying him into a different attack that unleashes powerful bursts of wind.<br><br>Cut to the Metalbenders. They are pulling at their whips, grunting with exertion, but they're starting to be pulled forward by their quarry. One even carves Earthbending gouges in the floor with his feet, but that fails to keep him in place. The view shifts to one of the Metalbenders' backs, where the spool of metal whip-wire is starting to smoke as the wire is yanked continuously by the struggle. The view cuts to one of the wrangled mechatanks, with two whips wrapped around its left claw. The arm moves around, trying to resist, then locks into place and pauses for a second. Suddenly, electricity emanates from the claw, traveling up the metal wire and shocking the Metalbenders. They all scream and get launched backwards. The mechatank is freed.<br><br>Lin, still stabbing away at her unmoving mechatank target despite having already shattered every window, turns to see what's going on and is immediately struck by one of the projectile grappling-claws. She is thrown off her mechatank, crashes and bounces off the nearby scaffolding, and then is yanked flying into the air by another mechatank. She comes to a hard landing on the floor and bounces a few times.<br><br>Elsewhere, Korra and Tenzin are double-teaming another mechatank. It's pushed up against a while, struggling against continuous fire and air blasts. The view cuts inside the tank's cockpit, where Hiroshi is being bounced around by the attacks. His pince-nez glasses are knocked off his face and fall off camera. Hiroshi growls, and pushes both his control levels forward. Outside, one of the mechatank's grappling-claws shoot forward at Korra, but she dodges with a series of backward flips that carry her out of the claw's continuing path. She Earthbends a chunk of the floor into the air and fires it back at the mechatank, but another claw comes at her from behind and catches her. She is pushed flying into a some of the metal machinery on the far side of the factory, and bounces off painfully.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Korra!<br><br><i>(As Korra falls, Tenzin shoots out a swirling sphere of air that catches her and lands her softly on the ground. Seeing her safe, Tenzin turns back to the mechatank and dodges another grappling-claw attack. Within his cockpit, Hiroshi works some more levers, and his tank rolls foward while firing its claws again. Another mechatank joins the attack. Tenzin once again dodges all the claws, and jumps into an Airbending move that summons a giant, spinning wind-wheel around him. Tenzin rides it forward like he's surfing and avoids another claw, then leaps into the air. Hiroshi's mechatank stops and fire some new projectile, a metal disc that deploys small, whip-like tendrils. It catches Tenzin as he spins through the air in preparation for another counter-attack, wrapping around and electrocuting him. He lands hard on the floor and stays down.<br><br>Hiroshi's tank comes to a stop, and the front opens into a series of panels that lets the driver climb out. Hiroshi steps down onto the factory floor and looks at his defeated enemies- Lin, Tenzin, Korra. The Lieutenant steps forward to join him.)</i><br><br><b>Hiroshi:</b> Well, I'd say that was a near flawless test run. <i>(turns to the other mechatanks and points at the Benders)</i> Load everyone into the transports and deliver them to Amon!<br><br><i>(The scene jumps to show a pair of trucks now parked amidst the mechatanks. Masked Equalists carry the unconscious Metalbenders to the trucks' cargo-containers. Off to the side, near where Tenzin, Lin, and Korra are lying, a panel of the floor lifts up slightly and scrapes to the side. Bolin and Mako peak out through the new hole in the floor.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Oh no.<br><br><i>(The Equalists toss another Metalbender into a truck.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Korra was right! We gotta do something, quick!<br><br><i>(As the Equalists continue their work, the brothers sneak closer, stopping to hide behind a large cylindrical tank. After pausing to make sure they haven't been spotted, they run out to the others. Bolin gets Tenzin and hauls the Airbender up onto his back, audibly struggling with the weight, while Mako lifts up Korra on his own back. Then they both lean down and each grab one of Lin's arms.<br><br>The view suddenly cuts to Hirshi, wearing mechanical gloves that crackle with electricity. The Lieutenant is beside him, fighting sticks at ready.)</i><br><br><b>Hiroshi:</b> Not so fast, boys.<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(drops Lin, and starts gesturing with Tenzin's arms)</i> Hello, Mr. Sato. Wow. What a really, swell, scary, factory you have here under your giant mansion.<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(icily angry)</i> Sponsoring our team, supporting the Avatar. It was all just a big cover.<br><b>Hiroshi:</b> Yes. And the most difficult part was watching my daughter... <i>(closes eyes)</i> traipse around with a Firebending streetrat like you!<br><br><i>(Hiroshi sends another shock through his gloves, and steps towards the brothers, but is halted by Asami's voice and turns around with surprise.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> Dad, stop! <i>(closes eyes and turns her head away, then looks back at her father, sad)</i> Why?<br><b>Hiroshi:</b> <i>(sadly)</i> Sweetie, I wanted to keep you out of this for as long as I could, <i>(view briefly cuts to Mako, still holding Korra as she wakes up)</i> but now that you know the truth, please, forgive me. These people, these benders... They took away your mother, the love of my life. They've ruined the world! But with Amon we can fix it, and build a perfect world together. <i>(Asami has a stunned expression, then averts her gaze.)</i> We can help people like us everywhere. <i>(Hiroshi takes off one of his electric gloves, and holds it out.)</i> Join me, Asami.<br><br><i>(Asami just stares, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. She slowly moves towards her father. She looks at the glove with an expression that could be as much fear as wonder, and reaches out a trembling hand. Mako, Korra, and Bolin all watch. Bolin looks crushed. Asami takes the glove, and slips it on. She looks at it on her hand, her expression harsh.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> No.<br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(sad)</i> I love you, Dad.<br><br><i>(Asami closes her eyes and turns her head, then shoves her gloved hand against Hiroshi's chest and hits him with a massive burst of electricity. He screams and then falls. As soon as he's down, the Lieutenant rushes over and tries to attack Asami with his sticks, but she gives a high kick that pushe his first blow out of the way. She stops his second attack by grabbing his wrist, and twists him around in an Aikido move that both brings him to his knees and shocks him with the glove. He collapses to the ground with a scream of his own.<br><br>Mako and Korra stare with stunned, slack-jawed expressions.

Just as Asami is escaping, leaving only Bolin, one of the mechatanks fires off a series of the electrified bola-disks that had been used to subdue Tenzin. Before the first one lands, Bolin hops down the hole and pulls it shut behind him by Earthbending an adjacent slab of the floor over like a door. The next two disks bounce harmlessly off.<br><br>The scene cuts to outside, where the Metalbender airship is flying away from the Sato estate. Within, Asami watches through the windows as her home shrinks away. She looks devastated, and clutches a pole for support. The camera zooms over her shoulder to show Mako looking at her, with Korra behind him, then continues past them to a bench where Lin is lying. Tenzin stands over her.)</i><br><br><b>Lin:</b> <i>(weakly)</i> My metalbenders are on their way to Amon, and it's all my fault. Tarrlok's right, I failed as Chief. First thing in the morning, I'm handing in my resignation.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(urgent)</i> No! You can't give up like this.<br><b>Lin:</b> <i>(weak, but angry)</i> I'm not giving up. <i>(pulls herself up into a sitting position)</i> I'm going to find my officers and take Amon down. But I'm going to do it my way, outside the law.<br><br><i>(Tenzin looks at her, but doesn't react.<br><br>Back with the others, Korra has her own defeated expression. Behind her, Bolin is looking out the window with Pabu on his shoulder.

I'm sorry this whole thing happened.<br><b>Mako:</b> So, does your offer to live at the Air Temple still stand?<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(smiling)</i> Of course it does. And Asami's welcome too.<br><b>Mako:</b> Thank you so much.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(puts a hand on Mako's shoulder)</i> After everything she's been through, she's going to need you, Mako.<br><br><i>(Mako nods, then turns around and approaches Asami. He puts his arm around her, and she shifts to look at him before snuggling against his chest. Korra watches for a moment, then turns away. Outside, the airship approaches the glowing Republic City.)</i><br><br><br><br>[End Credits]<br>

A ship that looks like a Chinese junk boat sails into view. Camera angle changes Bolin with Pabu on his shoulder standing near the edge of the boat looking excited at Air Temple Island. Pabu whistles and chirps. Behind him, Mako and Asami are cuddled up next to each other and they are also look equally excited about heading towards the island. Behind the couple, there is an Air Acolyte controlling the sails. The camera pans out to a beautiful view of the entire island as the boat pulls into the dock. Cut to the docks as Korra and the airbender kids wave to the boat.)</i><br><br><b>Ikki:</b> You're finally here! <i>(Two Air Acolytes lower a ramp from the boat to the dock.)</i> Welcome to Air Temple Island! <i>(Bolin has a bag slung over his shoulder and he proceeds to disembark.

The boy bends down curiously.)</i><br><br><b>Meelo:</b> What's that fuzzy creature? <br><br><i>(Meelo stands up and points off screen as the camera follows his movement. All the teens turn towards Pabu with a smile on their faces. We then see Pabu walking up to Naga and sniffing each other.)</i><br><br><b>Jinora:</b> <i>(off screen)</i> That is a Fire Ferret. <i>(Pabu stands up and uses its paw to touch Naga's snout. Cut to Jinora reciting the facts with a finger up in the air.)</i> An arboreal mammal common <i>(turns towards her brother)</i> to the bamboo forests of the central Earth Kingdom.<br><b>Ikki:</b> <i>(Ikki pops up from behind Jinora and gasps)</i> He's cuuute! <br><br><i>(Ikki squees and runs off screen towards Pabu. Meelo airbends upwards while Jinora puts a finger into her ears to silence Ikki's shrieks. Cut to Pabu who hisses at Ikki and runs under Naga. The girl follows suit as she continues giggling with joy. Meelo descends down on Naga's head  and grabs the polar bear dog's ears, pulling it backwards.)</i><br><br><b>Meelo:</b> Yip yip! Fly, sky bison, fly! <br><br><i>(Naga does not react to Meelo's antics and Ikki continues to chase Pabu around the dock. Cut to Korra looking at the children and Mako steps forward towards her.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Thanks for sending the air acolytes to help us with the move.<br><b>Asami:</b> Yes, they've been amazing! <i>(places a hand up with praise)</i> Such tireless workers.<br><br><i>(Cut to a side view of the boat as we see two Air Acolytes carrying several trunks of luggage. We can hear them grunting as they walk down the ramp.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Oh, I thought you were only bringing a few <i>(Korra shrieks on that word as the luggage threaten to topple onto her but the Air Acolytes manage to balance themselves in time.)</i> things? <br><b>Mako:</b> Trust me, <i>(the Air Acolytes re-orientate themselves and they walk towards the island)</i> it could have been worse.<br><b>Korra:</b> No problem. Everyone here wants you guys to feel welcome.<br><br><i>(Cut to the gates of Air Temple Island as Naga chases after Pabu while the rest of the teens and children stroll behind them. Ikki runs around with her hands outstretched as she hums gleefully. Cut to a side view shot of Asami, Mako and Jinora. Asami turns towards her right and her expression changes to curiosity. Camera cuts to reveal Meelo staring rather adoringly at her with a smile on his face.)</i><br><br><b>Meelo:</b> You're pretty, <i>(reaches a hand upwards)</i> can I have some of your hair?<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(Camera returns back to the walking trio)</i> Looks like <i>(Asami turns her head back towards Mako)</i> I have some competition.<br><br><i>(Camera pans out to the whole group and Ikki turns back to address the newcomers.)</i><br><br><b>Ikki:</b> And now for the grand tour! <i>(Cut to Ikki's back view as she points to the left and the teens turn their heads towards that direction)</i> The flying bison sleep in those caves down there, <i>(Ikki turns towards the camera and points upwards as the teens look up)</i> and that's the temple Grandpa Aang built, <i>(the girl points to the right and again, the teens look toward the direction she's pointing)</i> and that's the greenhouse where we grow the vegetables we eat! <br><br><i>(The teens turn their heads back towards Ikki and we cut to a close up of Ikki with a wide smile on her face.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(off screen)</i> I have a couple questions. <i>(Ikki drops her smile and turns her attention towards the earthbender.

Korra turns towards the camera and walks off.)</i><br><b>Korra:</b> Ikki and I will take you to your room this way.<br><br><i>(Asami follows Korra and we cut to what appears to be the women's dormitory. Camera cuts again to a corridor inside the dormitory to show the three girls walking down. Cut to a close up of the trio.)</i><br><br><b>Ikki:</b> Asami, <i>(the older girl turns towards Ikki)</i> did you know Korra likes Mako?<br><br><i>(Korra stops in her tracks as her eyes grow wide open in horror. We cut to the inside of her head as her face contorts comically and she screams with terror. Fire and lightning effects are shown in the background to emphasize Korra's shock. Fade back to real life as Korra looks all awkward and scared behind Asami.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> Oh, uh, no, I wasn't completely aware of that.<br><br><i>(Korra grabs Asami's elbow and pulls her off screen. We cut to a set of doors and Korra slides them open to reveal Asami's room. She turns around and smiles at Asami as she gestures into the room. Asami walks into the room and looks around. Korra enters the room and slams the door shut before Ikki can enter.)</i><br><br><b>Ikki:</b> Hey!<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(off screen)</i> Run along, Ikki! <br><br><i>(Ikki sighs as her eyes glow white comically and she roars like a tiger as she claws her hand around like a cat. Her eyes stop glowing as she folds her arms and pouts angrily. Cut to the inside of the room with Korra leaning against the door while Asami looks lost in though.)</i> <br><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(sighs and rubs the back of her head)</i> So... <i>(walks towards Asami)</i> here's your room! <i>(Camera pans across the slightly bare room)</i> I know this is a little rustic compared to what you're used to...<br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(Cut to a frontal shot of the teens)</i> I think it's really charming. <i>(walks towards the window)</i> And the best part about it? Nothing here reminds me of my father. Thank you for your hospitality.<br><br><i>(Her sentence gets interrupted by a few urgent knocks on the door.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Ikki, I swear, <i>(Korra looks at the door angrily while Asami stares at her, shocked.)</i> if you don't leave us alone I'm gonna- <i>(Cut to the doors as they slide open to reveal Tenzin. Cut back to Korra who has a comical expression of shock and attempts to calm down)</i> Uh, Tenzin! Come right in! <i>(Cut to a side view shot of the scene as Tenzin walks into the room)</i><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Good day, ladies. Asami, welcome to the island. <br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(bows towards Tenzin)</i> Thank you for having me.<br> <b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(Tenzin returns the bow and turns towards Korra)</i> Bei Fong's replacement Saikhan is going to be inducted as the new Chief of Police later. I think we should both be there.<br><br><i>(Scene changes to the outside of city hall where a crowd gathers to hear Saikhan's speech.)</i><br><br><b>Saikhan:</b> <i>(voice over)</i> It was an honour, serving under chief Bei Fong for so many years, <i>(Cut to a close up of Saikhan at the podium with Tarrlok and another council member standing behind him)</i> and I wish her a speedy recovery. It is with great humility that I take her place as the new chief of police. <i>(Camera pans out to show a full frontal view of the podium. The entire council, Korra and a few cops are standing behind him)</i> Republic City is facing a threat like none the world has ever seen, but there is one man who has been effective against Amon's revolution. <i>(Cut to Tarrlok)</i> Councilman Tarrlok! <i>(Tarrlok gives a polite bow while some reporters take a couple of pictures.)</i> That is why, <i>(Tarrlok smiles at Saikhan)</i> for all matters involving the Equalists, <i>(Cut to Tenzin and an angry looking Korra)</i> I will report directly to him. <i>(Korra and Tenzin are shocked by the revelation and turn their heads towards Saikhan)</i> The police department <i>(Tenzin turns his head back to Korra to reassure her and Korra turns her head back to the crowd)</i> will lend any and all available resources <i>(Camera returns back to Saikhan)</i> to the councilman and his task force, until we <i>(slams a fist into the podium)</i> quell this insurgency! <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(Cut to Tenzin and Korra as she whispers)</i> What is that weasel-snake Tarrlok up to now?<br><br><i>(Both of them glare at Tarrlok while the camera angle changes to the councilman. Ominous music plays in the background. Camera fades to reveal the crowd in front of the police station has dissipated. Cut to Tarrlok shaking the Fire Nation councilwoman's hand as she walks away with the rest of the council members while Tarrlok bows, smiling. Tenzin walks into screen.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Tarrlok, <i>(Tarrlok turns his head towards Tenzin)</i> I don't know what you did to get Chief Saikhan in your pocket, but I highly doubt it was legal. <i>(Tarrlok still has a smile on his face)</i><br><b>Tarrlok:</b> Oh, Tenzin. Always the conspiracy theorist. Did you ever consider Saikhan simply recognizes my talents <i>(places a hand on his chest)</i> and wants what is best for this city? <i>(Cut to Tenzin as he makes a 'hmph' sound. Korra steps forward to stand beside Tenzin. She is still glaring at Tarrlok)</i> Well, Avatar Korra, long time no see. Now that your little Pro-Bending distractions are over, I look forward <i>(raises a hand out)</i> to your return to my <i>(places a hand on his chest)</i>task force.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(Cut back to Korra with her arms crossed)</i> Huh, forget it! There's no way I'm rejoining your vanity project.<br><b>Tarrlok:</b> <i>(Cut back to a slightly disappointed Tarrlok)</i> That is unfortunate to hear. But I'm sure you'll come to your senses as you have in the past.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(Camera returns back to a defiant Korra)</i>Don't hold your breath, bub. Y'know, <i>(points a finger at Tarrlok)</i> Tenzin's been right about you all along. You played me, <i>(points to herself)</i> you played Bei Fong, <i>(points off screen)</i>and now you're playing <i>(points at Tarrlok)</i>  the new Chief of Police too. <i>(swipes her hand to the side dismissively as she steps towards Tarrlok.)</i> Well I've got news for you, <i>(Cut to a side view shot of the scene as Korra confronts Tarrlok and points a finger in front of his face. Tarrlok looks amused.)</i> you need me, but I <i>(stands up straight)</i> don't need you. I'm the Avatar.<br><b>Tarrlok:</b> <i>(calmly)</i> You're not, in fact, <i>(Korra looks slightly surprised)</i> the Avatar. <i>(Cut to a front shot of Tarrlok as he looks down on her)</i> You are merely a half-baked Avatar <i>in training</i>. Which reminds me, how is your <i>(points towards Korra)</i> airbending going? <i>(Cut to a close up side view shot of Korra as her eyes quiver and she looks sad)</i> Made any significant progress with that? <i>(Korra look down angrily)</i> I... <i>(Cut back to Tarrlok as he shakes his head)</i> didn't think so. If you will not be part of my task force, <i>(walk away)</i> then you had best stay out of my way.<br><br><i>(Tenzin steps forward and lays a hand on Korra's shoulder reassuringly. Korra looks up angrily. Scene changes to an overhead shot of Tenzin and Korra riding on Oogi as it flies through Republic City.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> I don't understand what's wrong with me! <i>(Cut to a close up of Korra)</i> I've memorized nearly all the practice forms but I still can't produce a single measly puff of air!<i>(gestures her arm around in frustration)</i> I'm a failure.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(Cut to a front view of Tenzin)</i> No you're not. <i>(Korra turns her head towards her mentor)</i> You just need to work through this airbending block.<br><b>Korra:</b> Amazing advice, I'll get right on that!<br><b>Tenzin:</b> I wasn't finished yet. You see, Aang not only had his bending teachers but <i>(Camera angle changes to a close up shot of Tenzin)</i> also his past lives to call upon for guidance. <i>(turns back towards Korra)</i> Have you ever made contact with your past lives?<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(Camera returns back to a front view of Tenzin)</i> No, of course I haven't! Didn't you get the memo from the White Lotus? I'm a spiritual failure too.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(turns his head back to the front)</i> You may have made a connection without realizing it. <i>(Cut to a frontal shot of a mopey Korra)</i> Perhaps, something you mistook as a dream?<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(blinks and replies uncertainly)</i> Maybe... I had a few weird hallucinations... <i>(Cut to Tenzin's back view)</i> but I hardly even remember them.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(He turns towards the camera)</i> And did you see any of the previous avatars in these visions?<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(Camera returns back to Korra)</i> I saw Aang... it seemed like he was in trouble. What do you think it means?<br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(Cut to a side view shot of Tenzin)</i> Hm. I don't know. <i>(strokes his beard as he thinks)</i> But I urge you to meditate on these visions. <i>(Scene changes to a far shot of Oogi flying over the sea towards Air Temple Island)</i> I believe Aang's spirit must be trying to tell you something.<br><br><i>(Fade to evening as the camera points towards Avatar Aang's statue. Camera slowly pans back to reveal Korra staring at his statue. The angle changes to show Korra sitting on a cliff. Cut to a close up of Korra as we see tears streaming down her face. She cries and grabs her head, upset.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(off screen)</i> Korra? <i>(Korra turns her head towards the voice)</i> You out here? <br><br><i>(She proceeds to wipe the tears from her face. Cut to a bush as Pabu's head peeks out and it chirps. )</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(hollers off screen as Pabu climbs onto Korra's shoulder)</i> Kooorrraaa! <i>(Pabu stops in front of Korra and lick the tears off her eyes. Camera pans out to show Bolin, Mako and Asami walking towards her and Pabu jumps off.)</i> There you are. <i>(Bolin reaches down so Pabu can climb onto him)</i> Are you okay?<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(shrugs)</i> I'm fine.<br><b>Mako:</b> Come on, what's wrong? You can tell us.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(Cut to a close up of Korra as she sighs)</i> How am I <i>(looks towards the group)</i> supposed to save the city when I can't even learn airbending? I'm the worst avatar ever! I just feel...alone.<br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(Cut to a close up of Asami and Mako)</i> No that's nonsense, you are amazing! <br><b>Mako:</b> Yeah, and remember, Aang hadn't mastered all of the elements when he was battling the Fire Nation. He was just a little kid!<br><b>Bolin:</b> And he wasn't alone! <i>(Camera pans to left to show Bolin)</i> He had his friends to help him. Look, <i>(points a finger up)</i> the arena might be shut down, but we're still a team, <i>(raises his hand out hopefully)</i> the new Team Avatar! <i>(Cut to an overhead shot of the cliff)</i><br><b>Mako:</b> We got your back Korra, <i>(everyone places their hands on top of each other)</i> and we can save the city, together! <i>(Korra stands up and places her hand down)</i><br><b>Korra:</b> Yeah, let's do it!<br><b>Meelo:</b> <i>(Meelo suddenly descends on their hands, farting loudly as they look on in horror)</i> Yeah, let's do it! <i>(raises a hand up in the air)</i> What are we doing? <br><br><i>(Meelo lowers his hand as the team laughs heartily. Scene changes to a night view of Republic City as the camera slowly pans out to reveal Bolin looking at the city.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Get ready, Republic City. <i>(Cut to a frontal shot of Bolin as the rest assemble)</i> You <i>(points to the city)</i> are about to be patrolled by Team Avatar. <i>(Bolin pats his bicep as Asami walks into screen with an Equalist glove in her hand.)</i><br><b>Mako:</b> Asami, you always know how to accessorize your outfits.<br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(Cut to Asami's hand as the camera pans upwards)</i> I figure one way to fight Equalists is to use an Equalist weapon. <i>(The glove sparks in her hand.)</i><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(Cut to an enthusiastic Korra)</i> All right. <i>(punches a fist into her palm)</i> Let's ride. <br><b>Bolin:</b> Naga away! <br><br><i>(Camera pans out to reveal Mako, Asami and Korra already seated on Naga. As Bolin jumps onto Naga, the polar bear dog roars and bends forward, making all of them slide to the ground. The animal shakes its head playfully.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(Cut to an embarrassed Korra as she stands up)</i> All right, scratch that. Any other ideas?<br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(Cut to Asami as she stands up and flips her hair)</i> Hm, <i>(rests a hand on her chin in thought)</i> I think I have the answer. <br><br><i>(Cut to the wheels of a Satomobile in the dark as the garage door opens to reveal Mako, Bolin and Korra on the other side. Cut to the front lights of the car as it turns on while Bolin raises his hand to shield his eyes from the bright light. Cut back to the inside of the garage as the car revs its engines and proceeds to drive out of the garage, tires screeching and black smoke billowing from the exhaust. Cut to a frontal shot of the car as it speeds out.

Korra and Bolin sit in the back seat while Mako sits in the passenger seat beside Asami.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> I like the new Team Avatar style.<br><br><i>(Asami proceeds to change gears and the car speeds off. Scene changes to the heart of Republic City as Team Avatar's car sails down the street. Camera pans to Asami, a top view of the car and back to Korra.)</i><br><br><b>Police Radio:</b> <i>(voice over)</i> Unit 216, cancelled at 1058 at Army Tower. <i>(Cut to the end of the street as the car continues to drive)</i> Come back to the station.

Jailbreak at headquarters, <i>(Cut to the radio panel of the car)</i> officers down, electrocuted! <i>(Cut back to the group, still listening in)</i> Chi-blockers and Equalist convicts are still at large, armed and dangerous, last seen heading east! <br><b>Bolin:</b> Whoa. <i>(Everyone look at each other)</i><br><b>Police Radio:</b> I repeat, Level 4 alert! Equalist jailbreak!<br><br><i>(Camera pans to a street as a couple of motorcycles and a van speed by an intersection while the surrounding cars brake suddenly to prevent impact.

Asami swerves the car to avoid the fallen Equalist. <br><br>Camera pans down to a third Equalist who looks back at the commotion. He thumbs a switch on his dashboard with a click and we cut to the exhaust pipes of two motorcycles as black smoke billows out.

Cut to Asami who proceeds to electrocute the Equalist. He moans in pain and falls into the backseat, unconscious.<br><br>Cut to a side view shot of the front of the car as both of Mako's wrists are tied up by bolas. The Equalist pulls him forward while Korra yanks Mako backwards, causing the Equalist to fall into the passenger seat. Asami electrocutes him as well. Cut to the back of the car as Mako shoves the unconscious chi blocker off the car. He gets into a stance. Camera angle changes to the front of the Equalist van and Asami pulls her car beside the van while Mako shoots lightning towards the van's driver. The van immediately loses control and it flips on the road, skidding across the surface and knocking over a lamp post before coming to a stop. Cut to an overhead view of the chaos as Asami pulls the car up alongside the truck and Team Avatar disembarks.<br><br>Scene changes to the flash of a camera taking a few pictures. Camera pans out to show the reporters taking photographs of a line of Equalists tied up and seated on the road with Team Avatar standing guard behind them. A police siren is heard and a couple of police vehicles pull into the road. Tarrlok leaves one of the vehicles and we cut to Korra looking smug. Cut to Tarrlok looking rather angry as he walk towards Korra with the cops behind him.)</i><br><br><b>Tarrlok:</b> Avatar Korra, what do you think you're doing?<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(Cut to a smirking Korra as a cop behind her picks up the capture Equalist)</i> Oh, hey, Tarrlok! Nice of you to show up, finally. <i>(gestures a hand out)</i> Here, we captured the escaped convicts for you.<br><b>Tarrlok:</b> <i>(frowns)</i> What you did was tear up the city and impede the real authorities in their pursuit of these criminals.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(raises an eyebrow and patronizes Tarrlok)</i> Hm, that's funny, I didn't see your little task force or the cops the whole time! If it wasn't for Team Avatar, they would have gotten away.<br><b>Tarrlok:</b> <i>(Cut back to Tarrlok as he points a finger at Korra while a cop behind him brings the suspect into the police vehicle)</i> This is your last warning! Stay out of my way. <br><br><i>(Tarrlok swipes his hand aside angrily and turns on his heel to head back to the police transporter. Cut to a smug Korra as the camera pans to the side to show the team joining her with the same smug expression on their faces.<br><br>Scene changes to the next day in front of the city hall as the citizens walk about.)</i><br><br><b>Tarrlok:</b> <i>(voice over)</i> Republic City stands as a beacon of freedom. But the Equalists are using that freedom to tear it down. <i>(Cut to Tarrlok addressing the rest of the council members inside city hall.)</i> The law I have proposed would make it illegal for anyone to be a member of the Equalists, or even be associated with them. It also puts into effect a curfew, ensuring all nonbenders are in their own homes by nightfall.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(Cut to a furious Tenzin)</i> This is going too far, Tarrlok! <i>(stands up)</i> You can't punish all nonbenders for the actions of a few! <i>(swipes hand aside angrily)</i><br><b>Tarrlok:</b> That kind of cowardice will cause our city to fall into Amon's hands. We must pass this law. All in favour?<br><br><i>(Cut to the Fire Nation councilwoman looking at the Earth Kingdom councilman. She raises her hand and he follows suit. The camera pans to the right to reveal the Southern Water Tribe councilman with his hands raised as well. The majority wins and Tenzin sighs and gestures dejectedly. Cut to a scheming Tarrlok.<br><br>Scene changes to night fall on a street in Republic City. The camera zooms in on the team resting against the car. Camera angle changes to a closer up of the car to reveal the team eating some flour buns.)</i><br><br><b>Police Radio:</b> <i>(radio cracks to life)</i> All available units, please respond <i>(the whole team turns their head towards the radio)</i> to the 5600 block of Dragon Flats borough!

Proceed with caution! <i>(Everyone proceeds into the vehicle)</i><br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(jumping over the windshield into the passenger seat)</i> I call front! <br><br><i>(Cut to the side view of the car as Mako gestures his hand out.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> After you.<br><b>Korra:</b> What a gentleman, <i>(Mako takes her hand and boosts her up into the backseat)</i> thanks!<br><br><i>(Mako jumps in after her.

Everyone gets out of the car and Asami pulls her goggles up. We can hear a crowd and camera angle changes to an overhead view of the block. A lot of police vehicles have blocked the street and the citizens are held behind a police barricade. Cut to a line of police officers standing guard as the crowd boo and jeer at the policemen. Cut to a frontal shot of the team.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> Wait a second, these people aren't armed or dangerous.<br><b>Korra:</b> Sure doesn't look that way.<br><br><i>(The whine of a microphone sounds and they turn towards the noise. Camera cuts to Saikhan standing on top of an armored police truck holding a microphone in his hands and addressing the crowd.)</i><br><br><b>Saikhan:</b> All nonbenders, return to your homes immediately!<br><b>Nonbender Man:</b> <i>(Cut to a random man in the crowd)</i> Yeah, as soon as you turn our power back on! <i>(The people around him cheer in agreement while the camera returns back to Saikhan.)</i><br><b>Saikhan:</b> Disperse, or you will all be arrested!<br><b>Nonbender Woman:</b> <i>(Cut to a random woman in the crowd holding a toddler in her arms)</i> You benders can't treat us this way!<br><b>Child:</b> Mommy, look!

I'm gonna put a stop to this! <br><br><i>(She walks away and we cut to Saikhan adjusting his hat irritably. Cut to a frontal shot of Korra as she stops and turns. Camera angle changes to show that she is looking at Tarrlok standing outside a tent talking to a police officer.)</i>  <br><br><b>Korra:</b> Tarrlok! <i>(Cut to a close up of Tarrlok as he turns towards Korra)</i> You need to turn the power back on and leave these people alone!<br><b>Tarrlok:</b> <i>(frowns)</i> Avatar Korra, you and your playmates have no business here!<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(Cut to Korra staring at Tarrlok angrily)</i> We're not going anywhere! You don't have the right to treat these innocent people like criminals. <i>(Cut to a side view shot of the entire scene)</i><br><b>Tarrlok:</b> This is an Equalist rally. <i>(points to the crowd)</i> There's nothing innocent about it.<br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(steps forward)</i> They're not Equalists. They're just normal people who want their rights back.<br><b>Tarrlok:</b> <i>(incensed)</i> They are the enemy! <i>(turns towards the cops)</i> Round up all these Equalists!<br><br><i>(Cut to an overhead view of the block as the cops approach the crowd. Cut to their boots as they stomp on the ground and camera quickly pans up to show their arms outstretched in a bending gesture. The supports of the barricade fall apart, leaving the red and white barricade boards floating in the air. The crowd begins to panic when the boards move towards them and they attempt to retreat. Cut to the cops as they perform a metalbending gesture simultaneously and we return back to a small group in the crowd as the barricade board encircles them. Screaming ensues and camera zooms out to show most of the crowd being trapped by the boards. Cut back to the cops again as they stomp their feet and bring their hands up. We return back to the crowd as the earth beneath them comes off the ground. Cut to the rest of the crowd who yell in fear and they begin to run away.

You can't do that! <br><b>Tarrlok:</b> <i>(Cut to Tarrlok pulling Asami to the cops as they cuff her)</i> Actually I can.

Can this wait? <br><b>Tenzin:</b> No it cannot. Three of Avatar Korra's friends were wrongly arrested tonight. I'd like you to release them immediately.<br><b>Saikhan:</b> They're not going anywhere. They were interfering with police business.<br><b>Korra:</b> Your so-called police business was rounding up innocent people and claiming they were Equalists! They should be released too!<br><b>Saikhan:</b> All Equalist suspects are being detained indefinitely. They will be freed if and when the task force deems they are no longer a threat.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> Those people are titled to due process under the law!<br><b>Saikhan:</b> You'll have to take that up with Councilman Tarrlok.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> Oh I plan to.

Spit it out.<br><b>Korra:</b> Don't you see? You're doing exactly what Amon says is wrong with benders! You're using your power to oppress and intimidate people! <br><b>Tarrlok:</b> And you don't?<br><b>Korra:</b> Of... of course not! <br><b>Tarrlok:</b> Isn't that what you came here to do? Intimidate me into releasing your friends? <i>(cut to Korra for a moment as she glares silently)</i> See, that's what I admire about you, Korra. Your willingness to go to extremes in order to get what you want. It is a quality we both share.<br><b>Korra:</b> You and I are nothing alike! <br><b>Tarrlok:</b> Look, I'll make you a deal. You fall in line, and do what I say, and I'll release your friends.<br><b>Korra:</b> That's why you arrested them? To get to me?<br><b>Tarrlok:</b> I need your answer.<br><b>Korra:</b> No. You might be able to manipulate Chief Saikhan into following you, but it won't work on me.<br><br><i>(Tarrlok stands up and turns around, facing the waterfall.)</i><br><br><b>Tarrlok:</b> You will regret that decision.<br><b>Korra:</b> You need to be stopped!

It cuts off some strands of hair and smashes into the bookshelf behind her as she rolls out of the way. Korra earthbends the floor at Tarrlok, knocking him back into the waterfall. She then lunges and shoots two streams of fire from her fists at Tarrlok. Tarrlok waterbends a bubble around himself to block the attack. After the attack stops, Tarrlok begins throwing little shards of ice at Korra in rapid succession. Korra back flips to dodge, and the scene goes into slow motion as it cuts to a close up of her in the air. Korra is pushed back against the wall. She grunts and dodges and deflects the shards with her fists as the scene goes into slow motion and we cut to a close up again. One shard grazes her side and she grunts in pain. Tarrlok continues the hail of ice, and Korra lifts up a large stone slab with earthbending to defend herself. Korra grunts as she swings her arms around, and earthbends the mural behind the waterfall. The mural rotates and catches Tarrlok by surprise, knocking him through the wall. He stumbles over the railing, but catches it before he falls.<br><br>Tarrlok catches his breath, his hair a mess, and looks up at the battle worn Korra as she stands in front of the hole on the wall.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Still think I'm a half-baked Avatar? <i>(bends the floor and knocks Tarrlok down to ground level.

You're all out of water, pal!<br><br><i>(Korra begins to approach Tarrlok as he crawls backward. She raised her palms up and creates flames in each hand. Korra lets out a battle cry as she lunges at Tarrlok. Tarrlok stands and holds his hands out, making Korra stop in her tracks and causing the flames to fly to either side of Tarrlok. Korra grunts in pain a moment, then Tarrlok moves his hands, causing Korra's arms to twist back. She groans in pain as Tarrlok holds his stance, and his hand movements force her to her knees.)</i><br><br><b>Tarrlok:</b> You're in my way, Avatar, and you need to be removed!<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(paralyzed and terrified)</i> You're... you're a... bloodbender?<br><b>Tarrlok:</b> Very observant. <br><b>Korra:</b> Itís... not a full moon how... how are you doing this?<br><b>Tarrlok:</b> There are a lot of things you don't know about me.<br><br><i>(Tarrlok twists Korra around before throwing her against a pillar. Cut to Korra as she falls to the floor and looks stunned. Cut to Korra's point of view as she watches Tarrlok approach her before her vision blurs and fades out. Cut to a flashback dream of the close up of Yakone's eyes, then to a shot of Sokka in pain, then to Toph throwing a metal cable out. Cut to a different angle showing the cable headed for Yakone before Toph is blood bent and the cable falls.

Cut to a shot of Korra showing her tied up.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Where are you taking me?<br><b>Tarrlok:</b> Somewhere where no one will find you. Say goodbye to Republic City, Avatar Korra! You'll never see it again.<br><br><i>(Korra sits up and roars at Tarrlok, breathing fire at him. Tarrlok closes the doors and avoids the fire just in time. Tarrlok slams his fist against the door and walks around to the front. Cut to a close up of Korra's profile.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> You can't do this! Let me out!<br><br><i>(Korra yells as the engine starts and the truck drives off. Cut to a shot of it driving down the city streets, then to a profile shot of Tarrlok, looking grim. Cut again to the truck driving down the streets at night, then tilt up to a shot of the mountains and the crescent moon in the sky.)</i><br><br><br><br>[End Credits]<br>

Camera angle changes to  a frontal shot of Korra who is struggling, spasming and appears to be in a lot of pain.

Camera pulls out to show a house out in the snowy wilderness and the Satomobile drives down the track. Cut to another scene of the snowy mountains and it is apparent that the place is deserted. <br><br>Cut to a building on Air Temple Island at sunrise and we hear a telephone ringing. We are shown a bedroom where Meelo is sleeping in between his parents. All of them are in their pajamas. As the phone rings, Meelo wakes up with a yawn, rubbing his eyes sleepily. He looks towards the phone and crawls over his father's face to pick him up. Tenzin gets rudely awakened by that. Meelo can be heard picking up the phone.

Cut to a close up of Tenzin walking in and we immediately change to the photographer's point of view through the camera lens as he focuses on an Equalist glove and takes a picture of it. After the flash, the view changes to the broken balcony and the photographer slowly pans his camera down to a bola wrapped around a pillar. Another picture is taken. After the flash, we see Tenzin walking towards Tarrlok as a waterbending healer heals Tarrlok's arm. Saikhan is taking notes.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> What happened? <i>(Tarrlok and Saikhan turn their heads to look at Tenzin)</i> What was Korra doing at City Hall?<br><br><i>(Tarrlok stands up and pull his sleeve down as the healer walk away.)</i><br><br><b>Tarrlok:</b> <i>(calmly)</i> As I told Chief Saikhan, Korra came to my office late last night.

He's Yakone's son.<br><b>Lin:</b> It all makes sense now. That's how Tarrlok was able to bloodbend us without a Full Moon.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> But how did you escape? And where's Tarrlok?<br><b>Korra:</b> Amon captured him... and took his bending.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(shocked)</i> What?<br><b>Korra:</b> Yeah. He showed up outta nowhere.

Oogi, yip yip. <i>(He disappears into the sky, Pema vanishes into the house, and Lin is left alone with her charge.)</i><br><b>Meelo:</b> <i>(picking his nose)</i> I gotta poo. Really bad.<br><br><i>(His contortions prove it. Horrified, Lin metalbends one of her tethers around him and dangles him at a safe length, rushing into the house.<br><br>A posh neighborhood in Republic City. The interior of the Fire Naton Councilwoman's home.)</i><br><br><b>Fire Nation Councilwoman:</b> Do you know where my keys are? I can't find them anywhere.<br><b>Councilwoman's Husband:</b> <i>(reading the paper)</i> No, dear.<br><b>Fire Nation Councilwoman:</b> Ooooh! Found them.<br><b>Councilwoman's Husband:</b> Good, dear.<br><b>Fire Nation Councilwoman:</b> Don't wait up for me. This council session will probably go late into the night. <i>(a knock at the door)</i><br><b>Councilwoman's Husband:</b> The door, dear.<br><br><i>(She opens the door to a suspicious-looking pair of exterminators. The moustache and voice of one reveal him to be Amon's Lieutenant.)</i><br><br><b>The Lieutenant:</b> We're here to fix the spider-rat problem.<br><b>Fire Nation Councilwoman:</b> I didn't call an exterminator.<br><br><i>(The Lieutenant electrocutes her and the pair enter the house.)</i><br><br><b>Councilwoman's Husband:</b> <i>(heard from offscreen)</i> Dear?<br><br><i>(The roof of City Hall. Tenzin, flying on Oogi, lands and begins walking across the roof.  A trio of workmen cleaning the glass dome on the roof reveal themselves to be Equalists and attack Tenzin. They are little match for his airbending and he quickly defeats them. The Council Page from previous episodes opens a door onto the roof just as the last gusts of wind from Tenzin's assault are dissipating. He cries out in alarm and shields himself before realizing who it is.)</i><br><br><b>Council Page:</b> I'm so relieved to see you.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> The other council members. Are they all right?<br><b>Council Page:</b> I'm afraid not. I just received a call from Chief Saikhan. They've all been captured!<br><b>Tenzin:</b> This can't be happening.<br><b>Council Page:</b> The leadership of Republic City is in your hands now.<br><br><i>(An explosion is heard offscreen. The two rush to the edge of the roof to see what it is. Bombs are exploding in the street. They look up to see a fleet of Equalist airships attacking the city.)</i><br><br><b>Council Page:</b> It is a tragic day indeed!<br><br><i>(Air Temple Island.  The assault on the city is visible from the courtyard, where Lin and the airbender kids stand aghast.)</i><br><br><b>Lin:</b> All right, kids. Time to go inside!<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(running outside with Mako, Bolin and Asami)</i> We heard explosions. What's going on?<br><b>Lin:</b> Republic City is under attack.<br><br><i>(The interior of one of the airships. Hiroshi gazes sadly at a portrait of his family from many years ago: his wife is still alive and Asami is just a child. He tucks the picture away in his waistcoat and a look of determination appears on his face. He walks up to stand beside Amon, whose airship this is.)</i><br><br><b>Hiroshi:</b> I've dreamed of this day for so long.<br><b>Amon:</b> Yes. The time has come for the Equalists to claim Republic City as their own.<br> <br><i>(Fade to commercial break.)</i><br><br><br><br><b><u>Act II</u></b><br><br><i>(Republic City, under attack. A ferry lands in the harbor. Team Avatar disembark.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> Where did you say you parked the car?<br><b>Korra:</b> It's right around here somewhere. There it is!<br><br><i>(They run towards the car. Korra seems to have used a lamppost in lieu of the brakes.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(sarcastically)</i> Wow. Nice parking job. <br><b>Korra:</b> Hey, you guys got arrested and left me alone with the car. I made it very clear that I don't know how to drive. <br><b>Bolin:</b> All things considered, you did a great job. But how are we going to pay for all these parking tickets? <br><br><i>(He pulls a sheaf of them from the windshield. Mako, impatiently, snatches them and destroys them in a burst of flame.  Bolin gasps at the illegality.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Relax. The city's under attack. The police have more important things to worry about. <i>(Bolin is crestfallen)</i><br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(pulling her electroglove out of the trunk)</i> This'll come in handy.<br><br><i>(They get in the car. Mako is about to get in the front passenger seat next to Asami.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(spitefully)</i> Why don't you sit in back... with Korra.<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(miffed)</i> I think I will. <i>(He does.)</i><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(to Mako, with concern in her voice)</i> Everything all right?<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(sarcastically)</i> Yeah. Everything's terrific.<br><br><i>(Asami careers into the road, nearly hitting another car. Bolin calls out a warning.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> CAR! Oh, we're good.<br><br><i>(Police headquarters. A command center.)</i><br><br><b>Police Clerk #1:</b> Chief, Air Unit Seven was just taken out by an Equalist airship. They've crashed into the harbor. <br><b>Saikhan:</b> Send a river rescue unit.<br><b>Police Clerk #2:</b> Chief, all river rescue ships have been sabotaged. <br><b>Saikhan:</b> What?<br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(entering)</i> Chief Saikhan.<br><b>Saikhan:</b> Tenzin! Am I glad to see you. I was afraid you'd been captured too. <br><b>Tenzin:</b> I'm the only council member left. What's the status?<br><b>Saikhan:</b> Amon has launched simultaneous attacks across the boroughs. The police are trying to regain control but we're spread too thin. <br><b>Tenzin:</b> I need to send a wire.<br><b>Police Clerk #1:</b> To whom, Councilman?<br><b>Tenzin:</b> The General of the United Forces.<br><br><i>(A corridor outside. Gas begins pouring from air vents in the walls, causing people to collapse. The scene returns to the command center.)</i><br><br><b>Police Clerk #1:</b> Councilman, your wire has been sent.<br><b>Police Clerk #2:</b> Chief, the phone lines just went dead!<br><br><i>(Alarms go off. The lights go out. Saikhan pulls out two flashlights and tosses one to Tenzin.)</i><br><br><b>Saikhan:</b> Catch! <br><br><i>(Gas begins pouring from the vents.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Saikhan, the vents! <i>(Saikhan metalbends them shut.)</i> We need to evacuate immediately. Everyone, stay close to me.<br><br><i>(Tenzin and the police staff walk down the hall, shielded from the gas by Tenzin's airbending. They emerge into the street, only to be confronted by a squadron of Hiroshi's mecha tanks.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Not these mecha tanks again!<br><br><i>(The mecha tanks activate magnetic arms, attracting the metalbenders' armor and making them easy captives. Tenzin tries to rescue Saikhan with airbending, but air is no match for electromagnetism. The mecha tanks deposit the police in the back of a waiting truck. They return to attack Tenzin and the police clerks. Tenzin holds them off with airbending as the clerks try to flee. The mecha tanks overcome Tenzin and as he sinks to the ground, he sees the truck begin to pull away.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Saikhan, no.<br><br><i>(Looking up, he sees a police airship in flames, falling out of the sky. Another truck filled with Equalist agents has arrived. Using their bolas, they capture the police clerks. Tenzin's vision fades and he begins to lose consciousness. The mecha tanks close in on him.<br><br>At that moment, Team Avatar come racing around the corner in the Avatarmobile. As the car heads straight toward the mecha tanks, Korra and Bolin earthbend a ramp in its path.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> Jump!<br><br><i>(The kids leap from the car as it hits the ramp and goes flying through the air, crashing into two of the mecha tanks and destroying them. Team Avatar run to the attack. Caught by one mecha tank's grapple hook, Mako redirects its electric charge into the machine itself, shorting it out. Korra disables another by bending water into its exhaust pipes, while Bolin knocks it over with earthbending. A group of Equalists are loading an unconscious Tenzin into a truck to be taken away. Asami confronts them and, using her glove and martial arts skills, defeats them. Tenzin recovers consciousness.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(to Asami)</i> Thank you.<br><br><i>(He joins the fight, airbending a mecha tank into the sky and atop a building. From above, in the safety of Amon's airship, Hiroshi views the conflict through a telescope.)</i><br><br><b>Hiroshi:</b> <i>(to Amon)</i> Tenzin has escaped once again. I can't stand to see Asami fighting alongside those <i>benders</i>.<br><b>Amon:</b> We will capture them before long. And you will have your daughter back.<br><br><i>(Below, the mecha tanks have been vanquished.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Are you all right?<br><b>Tenzin:</b> I'm fine. Thank you, kids. Another moment later and I would have been on my way to Amon.<br><b>Mako:</b> Uhhh, guys? Look.<br><br><i>(Mako points. Air Temple Island is visible from here, and as the group looks, they can see an Equalist airship hovering over the island.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Oh no.<br><br><i>(A hatch opens in the bottom of the ship, and Equalists descend on a zip line towards the island. The White Lotus sentries rush to defend against them.  In the courtyard, Lin and Tenzin's family watch their home being invaded.)</i><br><br><b>Lin:</b> Everyone, hide inside and remain calm. <i>(Pema cries out in pain.)</i> Pull it together, Pema. Didn't I just say remain calm?<br><b>Ikki:</b> Mommy? What's wrong?<br><b>Pema:</b> The baby's coming!<br><b>Jinora:</b> Oh no!<br><b>Meelo:</b> Not now, baby!<br><br><i>(Air Acolytes escort Pema away. Fade to commercial break.)</i><br><br><br><br><b><u>Act III</u></b><br><br><i>(A second Equalist airship has joined the attack on the island. The White Lotus sentries fight the Equalists using bending. The Lieutenant is the last to descend the zip line. He leads a group of Equalists into the heart of the island, where they encounter Lin, waiting for them.  She uses metalbending and earthbending to defeat several of them. The scene switches to a bedroom where Pema lies in labor. Two female Air Acolytes are attending her.)</i><br><br><b>Pema:</b> The children, where are they?<br><b>Elderly Air Acolyte:</b> Don't worry. They're in the other room, totally safe.<br><br><i>(In the courtyard, Lin attempts to subdue the Lieutenant with her metal cords, but he simply electrifies them with his kali sticks, giving her a shock that throws her to the ground. The Lieutenant approaches to deliver the decisive blow. Suddenly, Jinora swoops out of the sky on her glider.)</i><br><br><b>Jinora:</b> Stay away from my Dad's ex-girlfriend. <i>(She airbends the Lieutenant onto a nearby roof.)</i><br><b>Lin:</b> Jinora, you shouldn't be out here!<br><br><i>(Ikki joins the fray, riding on an air scooter.)</i><br><br><b>Ikki:</b> Get off our island! <i>(She knocks over Equalists using the scooter like a pinball.)</i><br><b>Lin:</b> Girls, you need to go back inside this instant!<br><b>Meelo:</b> <i>(jumping off a roof into a group of Equalists)</i> Taste my fury! <i>(He farts in the face of one of them.)</i><br><b>Lin:</b> Meelo, be careful!<br><br><i>(The warning is unnecessary, as Meelo handles the Equalists in his own spastic way.)</i><br><br><b>Lin:</b> Never mind.<br><br><i>(The conflict is over. Lin, the kids, and the Lotus sentries survey their captives.)</i><br><br><b>Lin:</b> <i>(to the sentries)</i> Take these Equalists and lock them in the temple's basement. <i>(to the kids)</i> Nice work, kids.<br><br><i>(Oogi lands in the courtyard, piloted by Tenzin and bearing Team Avatar on his back. The children run to their father.)</i><br><br><b>Jinora:</b> Dad!<br><b>Tenzin:</b> Oh thank goodness you're all right.<br><b>Meelo:</b> We caught the bad guys.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(to Lin, outraged)</i> You let them fight?

You taught them well. <i>(Tenzin gazes proudly at his martial offspring.)</i> Go on, be with your wife.<br><br><i>(In the hallway, Tenzin can hear a baby crying. He runs to the bedroom.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Pema!<br><br><i>(Pema is lying in bed, holding their newborn.)</i><br><br><b>Pema:</b> Tenzin.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(sitting beside her)</i> I'm here, Pema.<br><b>Pema:</b> Our new son.<br><b>Tenzin</b> <i>(taking the infant in his arms and gazing down fondly)</i> Well hello. <i>(to his children, who have followed him)</i> Come, meet your new brother.<br><b>Meelo:</b> A brother? Well it's about time.<br><b>Ikki:</b> Welcome! I'm Ikki and this is Jinora and Meelo. We have a super-great family and we're so happy that you're a part of it.<br><b>Jinora:</b> What're you going to name him?

The scene switches to the courtyard. Tenzin, Lin, and Team Avatar watch two Equalist airships flying in to renew the attack on the island.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> What do you want to do, Tenzin?<br><b>Tenzin:</b> I need to protect my family and get them as far away from this conflict as possible. If Amon got his hands on my children... I hate to even think of it.<br><b>Lin:</b> If you're leaving, then I'm going with you.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> But--<br><b>Lin:</b> No arguments. You and your family are the last airbenders. There's no way in the world I'm letting Amon take your bending away.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> Thank you, Lin. Korra, I want you to leave this island and hide for the time being.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(indignantly)</i> I'm not giving up.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> I'm not asking you to. I sent word to the United Forces. They will be here soon. And once my family is safe, I will return. With the reinforcements, we can turn the tide in this war.<br><b>Korra:</b> What you're saying is... we need to be patient. <br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(kindly)</i> You're learning well.<br><br><i>(The courtyard. Three sky bison bearing airbenders, air acolytes, and Lin, wait to take off. Team Avatar, Naga, and two Lotus sentries are bidding them farewell. Tenzin hugs Korra.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Stay safe, Korra.<br><b>Korra:</b> You too.<br><b>Lin:</b> Tenzin, if we're leaving, we better do it now.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> Oogi, yip yip.<br><br><i>(The sky bison take off. Two Equalist airships break away and begin following them. Another airship joins the attack on the island. Equalists descend on a zip line and confront the group. The sentries assume defensive postures.)</i><br><br><b>White Lotus Guard:</b> <i>(to the kids)</i> Go. We'll hold them off.<br><b>Korra:</b> Everyone, climb on! <i>(the kids mount Naga)</i> Let's go girl. <br><br><i>(Naga gallops off across the island. The Equalists and the sentries begin battling.<br><br>The kids seem to be getting away when the Lieutenant suddenly emerges nearby, sliding down a cliff towards them.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(calling out in warning)</i> Moustache guy!<br><br><i>(Naga leaps into the air to meet him in his descent, and with one swipe of her paw sends him flailing down onto the beach far below.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Nice one, Naga.<br><br><i>(Naga continues on, plunging off a pier into the bay. Korra waterbends a protective bubble around them and they begin swimming towards Republic City. The scene shifts to Lin and the airbenders, who are desperately trying to flee from the airships, to no avail.)</i><br><br><b>Lin:</b> They're gaining on us!<br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(flicking the reins)</i> Faster, Oogi!<br><br><i>(One airship shoots out a line with a net at the end, trying to capture the group. Lin destroys it with one of her own metal lines. As she sees their flight is hopeless, she tethers herself to a second line shot out from the airship and casts a wistful glance back at the airbender family. Her face hardens with determination.)</i><br><br><b>Lin:</b> Whatever happens to me, don't turn back.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(turning towards her)</i> Lin, what are you doing?!<br><br><i>(Running down the length of Oogi's tail, Lin leaps into the air. Retracting her metal line, she pulls herself up onto the roof of the airship. She metalbends a hole in the roof and pulls a large section free. An explosion occurs and the airship begins to sink out of the sky. As it does, Lin runs across the roof, propelling herself with metalbending onto the roof of the second airship. As she begins a similar demolition, Equalists emerge from a hatch in the roof and fling bolas around her, trapping her. She falls to the ground and is electrocuted. The airship veers away with its captive as the airbenders look on, stunned.)</i><br><br><b>Meelo:</b> That lady is my hero.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> Yes, she is.<br><br><i>(They fly on, safe for now. The scene shifts to the mouth of a sewer giving onto the bay, where the kids stand, about to flee into hiding. Air Temple Island is visible, and Korra stands, sadly gazing at the besieged temple. Mako comes up to her.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Korra, we should get moving.<br><br><i>(They head into the sewers, Mako's arm around Korra. Asami, with a sour look at them, follows. Later that night, it is raining on a conquered Air Temple Island. Lin is forced to her knees before Amon, surrounded by his forces. She glares up at him defiantly.)</i><br><br><b>Amon:</b> Tell me where the Avatar is and I'll let you keep your bending.<br><b>Lin:</b> I won't tell you anything, you monster.<br><b>Amon:</b> Very well.<br><br><i>(With no further ceremony, he unbends her. She slumps to the ground.<br><br>The scene shifts to the deck of a ship, on the open ocean. Daytime. A young officer in a red coat stands, looking out to sea. Another officer, bearded, dressed in gray with an Earth Kingdom insignia on his cap, comes up to him.)</i><br><br><b>Bearded Naval Officer:</b> General, I just received a wire from the Avatar.

After she reaches a certain height, Korra moves her hands around in a circular motion. Cut to an Equalist plane flying in the direction of the spout and an ice spike suddenly materializes out of the water in front of it. The plane crashes into it and one of its wings break off. The plane skids along the surface of the water and slams into Korra's water spout.

Since then, the Council was disbanded and the United Republic elected its first president. Tenzin's brother, Commander Bumi, retired and moved to Air Temple Island. And Korra and her boyfriend, Mako, have been the talk of the town. Peace has come to Republic City but unbeknownst to the Avatar, danger now threatens the Southern Water Tribe.       <br><br><br><br><b><u>Act I</u></b><br><br><i>(The film effect fades away to a shot of a fishing boat out on a dark, rainy night on the ocean as a fog horn blows. Cut to a shot of a Greenhorn and an Old Salt holding a lantern on the top deck of the boat.)</i><br><br><b>Old Salt:</b> This your first watch?    <br><b>Greenhorn:</b> Mm-hmm.               <br><b>Old Salt:</b> Well then, you'd better keep your eyes peeled, laddie. You never know what creatures lurk in the murky depths.<br><br><i>(The Greenhorn gasps and looks down at the water while the Old Salt turns to leave, laughing quietly. Cut to a bird's eye view of the boat as a squid-like spirit the size of the boat swims underneath it. Cut back to the Greenhorn.)</i>             <br><br><b>Greenhorn:</b> Uh, sir?<br><b>Old Salt:</b> What? Ahh!!!<br><br><i>(The Old Salt screams as the spirit grabs him with one of its tentacles and pulls him into the water.)</i><br><br><b>Greenhorn:</b> Man overboard! Man overboard!<br><br><i>(More tentacles emerge from beneath the water's surface and wrap around the fishing boat, pulling it under. The scene fades to the title card, then to a far, wide, panning down shot of the Pro-Bending Arena at night as spotlights shine around it. The fight bell can be heard ringing.)</i><br><br><b>Shiro Shinobi:</b> It's pro-bending night in Republic City and have we got a doozy for you. <i>(cut to an interior shot of the arena)</i> Fan favorites, The Fire Ferrets, are about to take on hot newcomers, The Rhino-Lions.<br><br><i>(Cut to Bolin and Pabu wearing their uniforms. Pabu is standing on a railing.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Now we all know that our last match was garbage. Terrible. Even Pabu could have done a better job. <i>(Pabu chirps and moves closer to Bolin)</i> But that's in the past, because when you back a Fire Ferret in the corner, well, mister, he comes out fighting! <i>(Pabu gets into a fighting stance and hisses.)</i> So let's get out there and bend like there's no tomorrow. Are you with me?     <br><br><i>(The camera pulls back as Bolin does a fist pump and we see the backs of his teammates. Cut to a shot of the front of the teammates as the firebender girl holds her arm and looks down nervously, and the waterbending boy wipes his nose with his arm and sniffs loudly. Cut to a close shot of Bolin looking disappointed before the fight bell is rung. Cut to a zooming out shot of the two probending teams facing each other on the floor of the arena, summoning the elements as they prepare to fight. The camera quickly pans right as the Fire Ferrets are all knocked back over the egde of the arena. Cut to an overhead shot of the team plunging into the water below.)</i><br><br><b>Shiro Shinobi:</b> Ooh, the Fire Ferrets go down in the water and right into the record books for the fastest knockout in pro-bending history.<br><br><i>(The fight bell is rung as we cut to a close up of Blolin climbing onto the edge of the floor out of the water, sighing in disappointment.)</i>           <br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Where's Mako when I need him? <br><br><i>(Cut to a closeup of Mako's motorcycle as he races it down the street and banks away from the camera. Police sirens are blaring from his bike as it flashes warning lights. Cut to a shot of a speeding truck taking a sharp turn at an intersection, its tires screeching. It drives towards the camera and past it with Mako in hot pursuit. Cut to a close up of Mako's eyes, wearing goggles over them, and slowly pan right. Cut to a shot from below with Mako's bike in the foreground as the gate of the truck ahead of him opens. Cut to a closer shot of two criminals in the back of thr truck, as one of them begins to waterbend. He holds the water out in front of the larger man. The larger man claps his hands together, and the water turns into steam, which engulfs Mako. The two waterbenders begin pouring more water onto the street. The smaller man exhales and the water turns into ice on the road. Mako gasps as his bike begins to slide over the ice. As it spins around, Mako throws fire at the ice and melts it, and regains balance. Cut to an overhead shot as the truck passes by a contruction site and smashes through a barricade. Another truck begins to cross in front of Mako. Mako banks to the left towards a makeshift ramp made of wooden boards leaning against a pickup truck. Cut to a close up profile shot of Mako and quickly zoom out as he uses firebending to boost his bike off the ramp. Mako flies over the escping truck. He twists his bike around in midair and shoots a blast of fire at the front of the tuck. The truck skids for a moment before the engine explodes, filling it with smoke. Mako lands in front of the truck and skids to a halt. The truck hits a fire hydrant and rolls on its side before it skids to a stop and its fuel tank explodes. Cut to a shot of three criminals climbing out of the broken windshield and landing in a pile on the street, exhausted. Mako approaches them and takes off his helmet and goggles, smiling.)</i>   <br><br><b>Mako:</b> Looks like you had some car trouble, good thing the police are here.<br><br><i>(The sounds of a plane engine is heard before we cut to a close up of a plane's landing gear hitting a landing strip. Cut to a close shot of one of the plane's propellers moving into frame, then cut to a shot of Asami climbing out of the cockpit and taking off her helmet. She is approched by an engineer.)</i>                <br><br><b>Asami:</b> I think these planes are finally ready to ship.      <br><b>Future Industries engineer:</b> I hate to mention the elephant-rhino in the room, but since your father was thrown in prison, no company will work with us. We're nearly bankrupt.     <br><b>Asami:</b> Don't worry, I'm going to the South Pole to meet with someone who can help us put Future Industries back on top.          <br><br><i>(Asami pats the engineer's shoulder and walks past him. The camera follows her as her smile turns into a frown of worry. Cut to an establishing shot of Airbender island as Oogi flies by. The camera follows the flying bison and stops at the ground, where we see Korra, Ikki, Jinora, and Meelo racing on air scooters. They disappear behind a hill for a moment before coming over the top of it in closer range of the camera, with Ikki ahead and Korra tailing behind. They go into a covered pathway where Pema is walking, holding Rohan, an ear of corn, and a large raddish. The airbenders speed by Pema, startling her and making her fumble with the vegetables.)</i><br><br><b>Pema:</b> Woah! Ah!<br><br><i>(Korra and the children race around the airbending gates, making them spin. Cut to a shot of them dropping over a ledge and racing past the camera. Cut to a medium close shot from the side of Ikki ahead of Korra in the background and Korra in the foreground. Ikki looks back at Korra with a smirk and Korra looks back. Cut to a close up of Korra smirking as she turns her head back to the front and her eyes glow as she enters the Avatar State. Cut back to the side shot. Ikki looks on with surprise as Korra takes the lead. Cut to an overhead shot as Korra passes through the torii gate and wins the race with Bumi waving a checkered flag. Cut to a shot of Korra as she dismounts the air scooter. Cut to Bumi coughing from the dust kicked up as the airbender children cross the finish line.)</i><br><br><b>Bumi:</b> The Avatar is the winner!<br><br><i>(Cut to a shot of Korra as she stands up and her eyes lose their glow as she exits the Avatar State. She turns and smirks and the camera pans left as Ikki approaches Korra angrily.)</i>       <br><br><b>Ikki:</b> No fair, you can't go into the Avatar State to win.<br><br><i>(Korra sticks her tongue out at Ikki and makes a raspberry noise.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(offscreen, sternly)</i> You did what? <i>(cut to Tenzin walking towards them)</i> The Avatar State is <i>not</i> to be used as a booster rocket. You are toying with a dangerous power that you obviously do not appreciate.          <br><b>Korra:</b> It's the "Avatar State" and I'm the Avatar. Who appreciates it more than me?       <br><b>Tenzin:</b> Clearly, you need more training to grasp the depths of your spiritual connections. Not to mention that you're still a <i>long</i> way from mastering airbending.           <br><b>Korra:</b> I have mastered airbending. <br><br><i>(The camera quickly zooms out as Korra punches blasts of air at the surrounding shrubbery, sending leaves floating.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> See? Mastered.         <br><b>Bumi:</b> Looks pretty good to me.   <br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(sighs and puts a hand to his face)</i> Is it too late for you to un-retire from the United Forces?     <br><b>Bumi:</b> The paperwork's gone through, little brother. From now on, it's 24/7 Bumi Time!<br><br><i>(Bumi grabs Tenzin's head and pinches his cheek. Tenzin makes him let go and walks up to Korra.)</i>      <br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> You've mastered Korra-style airbending. Now you need to master <i>real</i> airbending. Hopefully, our visit to all of the Air Temples will give you the inspiration you need to delve more deeply into your studies.          <br><br><i>(Tenzing unscrolls a map of the Earth with the locations of the Air Temples marked, along with a cartoonish caricature of himself with a thumbs up drawn in the middle. Cut to a medium close shot of Korra looking appalled, then irritated before the camera zooms out and we see Ikki, Meelo, and Jinora.)</i><br><br><b>Jinora:</b> Can we see where Grandpa Aang was born?  <br><b>Meelo:</b> How many lemurs can I have?           <br><b>Ikki:</b> I want to get tattoos, but instead of arrows, I want lightning bolts.     <br><b>Jinora:</b> You can't get lightning bolts, that doesn't make any sense.              <br><b>Ikki:</b> <i>(angry)</i> You don't make any sense!              <br><b>Meelo:</b> <i>(cheering)</i> Fight, fight, fight!<br><br>(Ikki and Jinora press their foreheads against each other as they growl and glare at one another, before Tenzin pulls them apart.)</i><br>    <br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(sternly)</i> No one's fighting! We're going to have a <i>wonderful</i> time. <i>(sighs and puts a hand to his face)</i> Now that the President is in office and I'm not needed on the council, I can finally relax with my family and give Korra the attention she needs.    <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(sarcastic)</i> Great. More attention.         <br><b>Bumi:</b> <i>(laughs)</i> Relax? I'd pay money to see that. Maybe I'll tag along just to see "Vacation Tenzin." <br><b>Tenzin:</b> You're not invited.  <br><b>Korra:</b> Before we go on your Dad's study trip, we're going to have some real fun in my hometown at the Glacier Spirits Festival. They've got rides, games, and all kinds of fried food on sticks.    <br><b>Jinora, Meelo, Ikki:</b> <i>simultaneously</i> Yay!<br><br><i>(The children begin running around Tenzin and Bumi and cheering. Tenzin clenches his eyes shut a moment and frowns from the stress as Bumi puts an arm around his shoulder.)</i><br><br><b>Bumi:</b> Yep, there's Vacation Tenzin. And you can't stop me from going to the festival, <i>Mom</i> already invited me.<br><br><i>(Cut to a long shot of a ship on the ocean at night with the moon shining above. Its horn blows and we cut to an overhead panning down shot of Korra and Mako sitting against Naga on the deck.)</i>    <br><br><b>Mako:</b> So I walk up and say, "Looks like you had some car trouble, good thing the police are here."   <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(chuckles)</i> Did you write that beforehand? <br><b>Mako:</b> Yeah, I had a few others. <i>(pulls out a piece of paper from under his shirt and reads)</i> Let's see, uh... "Looks like you guys should put more 'try' in triad," Huh? Or, "when you get to jail, tell 'em Mako sent ya."     <br><b>Korra:</b> Ooh, I like that one.     <br><b>Mako:</b> Okay, I'll use that next time. Bei Fong says if I keep it up, I could make detective soon.              <br><b>Korra:</b> Oh, that sounds <i>so</i> fun. All I do is train all day. It's like Tenzin's totally forgotten how I beat Amon.      <br><b>Mako:</b> Tenzin's just trying to help you become the best Avatar you can be.           <br><b>Korra:</b> Of course you'd take <i>his</i> side. <br><b>Mako:</b> I'm not taking his side. I'm just-<br><b>Korra:</b> I'm gonna take a walk.<br><br><i>(Korra stands up and walks out of frame. Mako and Naga watch her leave. Mako turns to Naga.)</i>    <br><br><b>Mako:</b> Why is it so much easier to bust triads than it is to get through one conversation with my girlfriend?<br><br><i>(Mako leans back against Naga and crosses his arms while Naga goes back to sleeping. Cut to a front overhead shot of the ship docked with a crowd of people gathered on the pier. Cut to a shot of Meelo, Jinora, and Ikki hugging Katara, while Kya stands to the side.)</i>      <br><br><b>Jinora, Meelo, Ikki:</b> <i>simultaneously</i> Gran-gran!   <br><b>Katara:</b> Oh, you've all gotten so big.         <br><b>Jinora:</b> <i>(hugs Kya)</i> We missed you, Aunt Kya.      <br><b>Kya:</b> Oh, I missed you too. <i>(cut to a shot of Tenzin, Bumi, and Pema with Rohan approaching them from the ship)</i> Your father doesn't bring you to visit nearly enough. He's probably scared I'll beat him up like when we were kids. <i>(lightly punches Tenzin's arm)</i>      <br><b>Tenzin:</b> I'm not scared of you... <i>(rubs his arm)</i> Any more. <br><br><i>(Cut to a side shot of Korra hugging Tonraq while Mako stands behind Korra and Senna stands to the side.)</i>          <br><br><b>Korra:</b> You remember Mako.  <br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(offers a hand shake)</i> Sir.  <br><b>Tonraq:</b> <i>(crosses arms sternly)</i> I hope you're not getting my daughter into any more trouble up in the city.      <br><b>Mako:</b> Uh, no. I, uh--no.              <br><b>Korra:</b> Knock it off, Dad.<br><br><i>(Tonraq chuckles and grabs Mako's hand, shaking it heartily. Bolin walks into frame.)</i> <br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Wow, look at all these people that came out to greet us.     <br><b>Korra:</b> Uh, no... they came to greet <i>them</i>.<br><br><i>(Cut to a long shot of a royal Northern Water Tribe ship docking on the other side of the pier.

It's fun.               <br><b>Unalaq:</b> This festival used to be a solemn time of fasting and meditation. Now it's just a chance to watch some rube try to stick an entire arctic hen in his mouth.   <br><br><i>(Cut to a shot of Bolin sticking a cooked arctic hen on a stick into his mouth, with the other characters in the background. He turns to them.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(with mouth full)</i> Wha- what? It's so good.    <br><b>Tonraq:</b> Traditions change. It's not the end of the world.    <br><b>Unalaq:</b> Tell that to the sailors who are being attacked by angry spirits in Southern waters. Some traditions have purpose.          <br><b>Korra:</b> Wait, spirits are attacking ships?  <br><b>Unalaq:</b> <i>(nods)</i> I'm surprised the Avatar doesn't know about that. Apparently you haven't been given all the information you need. It would be my honor to instruct you in the spiritual ways of the Water Tribe.       <br><b>Korra:</b> I wouldn't mind learning about fighting spirits. Airbending is getting pretty boring.     <br><b>Tonraq:</b> Tenzin is Korra's instructor. He can give her all the training she needs.<br><b>Unalaq:</b> So you've said.<br><br><i>(Cut to a wide shot of the top of Varrick's ship and pan down to Asami and Bolin with Pabu on his shoulder.)</i>  <br><br><b>Asami:</b> I'm glad you came with me to this meeting. Varrick is one of the richest men in the world, and he controls the <i>entire</i> global shipping business. So you're my assistant. Just stand there and don't say anything.     <br><b>Bolin:</b> No problem, Pabu and I are natural assistants. Man, this is nice. I gotta get into this whole "business" thing.<br><br><i>(Asami and Bolin walk up the plank towards the ship. Cut to Varrick sitting on a cushion, his eyes closed and his fingers pressed against his head in concentration while Zhu Li sits beside him, writing on a notepad. He is surrounded by guests. The camera pulls back and Asami and Bolin come into frame. Cut to a close shot of Varrick's feet and pan up to his face. He suddenly opens his eyes and grins in excitement.)</i>  <br><br><b>Varrick:</b> Did you see that? Levitation! I was a foot off the ground. Is that incredible or what?<br><br><i>(The camera pans around the room as the guests all clap.)</i>            <br>   <br><b>Male Guest #1:</b> How does he do that?     <br><b>Male Guest #2:</b>That's unbelievable.     <br><b>Male Guest #3:</b> That's amazing.<br><br><i>(Cut to a shot of Varrick as he stands up and bows. Cut to a side shot of Bolin and Asami. Asami claps as Bolin scratches the back of his head in confusion.)</i>           <br><br><b>Bolin:</b> It looked like you were just sitting on a pillow.<br><br><i>(Asami gasps and puts her face in her palm in embarassment. Cut to the guests as they gasp and turn to glare at Bolin. Cut to a close up of Varrick as he looks up in shock. He frowns and marches up to Bolin, leaning in close and making Bolin lean backwards as Asami watches. Pabu hides away in Bolin's shirt.)</i> <br><br><b>Varrick:</b> Are you saying I wasn't levitating?      <br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(gulps)</i> Uh... no?             <br><b>Varrick:</b> Well, why didn't anyone tell me? Now I look like an idiot! Swami, you're fired!<br><br><i>(Varrick points at the Swami, who bows deeply and quietly walks away backwards. Varrick watches him go, then roughly slaps an arm around Bolin's shoulder, making Pabu jump away in fright out of Bolin's shirt.)</i>     <br><b>Bolin:</b> Aah!<br><b>Varrick:</b> I like you kid, you're a real straight shooter, just like me. Ms. Sato? He's with you?    <br><b>Asami:</b> Mmm-hmm. <i>(sighs in relief)</i><br><b>Varrick:</b> Brought your tiger-shark with you to do business, huh? Now that's moxie. <i>(Zhu Li shoos away two of the guests to make room as Varrick sits Bolin down on a cushion.)</i> Get over here and pop a squat. Zhu Li, get some tea for my guests.<br><b>Asami:</b> Thank you for meeting with me. As you know, Future Industries is looking for a partner to handle our shipping-<br><b>Varrick:</b> Sure. But first, you gotta check out my new venture: moving pictures. Zhu Li, do the thing. You're gonna love this.<br><br><i>(Zhu Li shoves the tray of tea she is serving to Bolin into his arms. She quickly runs over to an object on a table with a red cloth draped over it. She removes the drape to reveal a film projector and quickly turns it on. Cut to Varrick and Asami as Varrick sits Asami down. The camera zooms in on the wall in the background as the projector starts. A silent, grainy clip of an ostrich horse running is played for a moment before Varrick's head comes into frame.)</i> <br><br><b>Varrick:</b> Mind-blowing, right?      <br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(impressed)</i> Yeah. <br><b>Varrick:</b> Now, forget that! That's the past! Shut it off, Zhu Li! Imagine watching <i>this</i>. Ginger, come over here and do your poses.<br><br><i>(Bolin gasps and we cut to a close up of a red haired women, Ginger, in a white fur coat, and saxaphone background music begins playing. The camera zooms out as she throws the coat to the floor and does a few sexy poses, puntuated by the music and a stylized background. Cut to Bolin, staring wide eyed and drooling, until Varrick gets in the way of his view. Bolin tries to look around Varrick at Ginger.)</i>        <br><br><b>Varrick:</b> Spectacular! And we tell a story; there's romance, action, some funny animal stuff for the kids. You know, whatever. Thanks Ginger, go rest your gams. <i>(sits between Bolin nd Asami)</i> How about that, tiger-shark? We're gonna do big business with these "movers," as I call 'em.<br><b>Asami:</b> Okaaay... but I'm just concentrating on getting Future Industries back on track. If we could hammer out a dea-         <br><b>Varrick:</b> Stop. Look me in the eye. <br><br><i>(Varrick presses his face right up against Asami and stares intensely into her eyes, making Asami look very awkward. The camera zooms in on them as there's a tense moment of silence. Asami gets a grip and stares back at Varrick with the same intensity. Varrick points his finger at Asami and grins.)</i> <br><br><b>Varrick:</b> We got a deal! <br><br><i>(The camera zooms out to an overhead shot as Varrick sits up straight and points upwards, making Asami fall over. Zhu Li helps Asamiu up and the guests all cheer. Cut to a closer shot of Bolin, Varrick, and Asami as Varrick shakes Asami's hand.)</i> <br><br><b>Varrick:</b> We'll hammer out the details at the royal feast tonight. Now, who wants a rocket-boat ride? <br><br><i>(The guests all cheer and follow Varrick out, leaving Asami, Bolin, and Pabu.)</i>         <br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Is that how business usually goes?    <br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(happily hugs Bolin and ruffles his hair)</i> You <i>are</i> a natural assistant.<br><br><i>(The scene cuts to several lanterns hanging overhead. The camera pulls back and focuses on an overhead shot of the dining room below. Cut to Korra and Unalaq sitting at the head table.)</i>      <br><br><b>Korra:</b> This is a wonderful feast in your honor, Uncle.    <br><b>Unalaq:</b> This is nothing. When this festival was founded, the tribal elders would commune with the spirits. People would watch the brilliant displays of light as spirits danced in the sky.<br><b>Korra:</b> Wow. I've never seen that. <br><b>Unalaq:</b> And that is a shame, since the Avatar is the bridge between the material world and the spirits. That is why I want so <i>badly</i> to teach you, to help you fulfill your destiny.<br><b>Tonraq:</b> <i>(camera zooms out to show him sitting next to Korra)</i> I thought I had made it clear that Tenzin is teaching her.        <br><b>Unalaq:</b> Every Avatar before you traveled the world to learn. It was Tenzin and your father who kept you secluded at the South Pole.          <br><b>Korra:</b> I thought Aang ordered the White Lotus to keep me down here?      <br><b>Tonraq:</b> We all did what we thought was best for you.  <br><b>Korra:</b> Who I train with should be my decision, Dad, not yours or Tenzin's.<br><br><i>(Cut to a shot of Tenzin looking back at Korra from further away. Bumi's head comes into frame and the camera zooms out to show Kya sitting beside Tenzin. Bumi gently elbows Tenzin.)</i>     <br><br><b>Bumi:</b> Looks like someone's trying to take your place as the Avatar's stick-in-the-mud mentor.    <br><b>Kya:</b> Bumi, don't pick on Tenzin, you know he's always been sensitive.   <br><b>Tenzin:</b> I'm not sensitive!<br><br><i>(Tenzing crosses his arms and pouts as Kya and Bumi laugh. Cut to a shot of Katara holding Rohan in the background while Kya pokes Tenzin in the shoulder. Zoom in and focus on Katara watching sadly. Cut to a shot of Unalaq's back as he stands up to address the room.)</i>      <br><br><b>Unalaq:</b> As your chief, it is my honor to speak at this festival, which was founded to bring our tribes together and restore the ancient balance between our world and that of the spirits. But I am saddened to see what it has become- A cheap carnival that celebrates greedy and trivial humans.<br><br><i>(Tonraq gives Unalaq an irritated look while he drinks from a cup. Cut to a shot of Varrick cleaning his teeth with his fingers while he uses his plate as a mirror. Bolin and Ginger are seated with him. Cut back to Unalaq.)</i>      <br><br><b>Unalaq:</b> I fear the time is fast approaching when the North can no longer stand idly by while our Southern brothers slip into total spiritual decay. Angry spirits are already attacking ships in your waters. I only hope we are not too late to change course. <br><br><i>(Unalaq sits back down and the people begin to mutter to themselves. Cut to a shot from the front as Varrick stands up into frame.)</i>          <br><br><b>Varrick:</b> Chief Unalaq, everybody. Always great to have him in town. Now let's have some fun with Wacky Wushu's dancin' otter-penguins.<br><br><i>(Cut to a wider shot as Varrick steps away and Wacky Wushu dances in from the right. He waterbends a slide on the floor which three otter penguins slide across. He bend the water back the other way and the otter penguins slide back into view, standing up in front of Wushu before they all bow. The scene cuts to a wide, overhead establishing shot of the festival at night. Cut to Bolin, Mako, and Korra. Mako feeds Korra some cotton candy, which she greatly enjoys before feeding some to Mako. Bolin is eating rice balls on a stick and stares at the two of them with an annoyed look. Bolin turns his head away and sees something. Cut to Bolin's perspective as he sees Eska and Desna. Cut to a closer shot of Eska and Desna, then cut back to Bolin, Mako, and Korra. Bolin clears his throat, smirks, and nudges Mako with his elbow.)</i>     <br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Wish me luck. <i>(hands Mako his rice balls)</i> I'm making my move. Whee!            <br><b>Mako:</b> Good luck.<br><b>Korra:</b> Those two have always creeped me out. They smell like a grandma's attic.<br><br><i>(Cut to Eska and Desna as Bolin approaches Eska.)</i>      <br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Hey, I'm Bolin, a friend of Korra's. You're Eska, right? Wow, I'm just... I'm loving these robes.<br><br><i>(Eska turns to glare and hiss at Bolin. Bolin is a bit taken back before clearing his throat.)</i>     <br><br><b>Bolin:</b> So... you are from the North, right? Cool. That's like, you know, that's like, my favorite direction.  <br><b>Desna:</b> I think he is trying to establish some kind of bond with you based on your geographic point of origin.        <br><b>Eska:</b> Perhaps it would be interesting to spend time with a person whose ways are so rough and uncultured. You amuse me. I will make you mine.      <br><b>Bolin:</b> You mean like a boyfriend or... like a slave?     <br><br><b>Eska:</b> Yes. <i>(grabs Bolin's collar)</i> Win me prizes.<br><br><i>(Bolin laughs nervously as Eska pulls Bolin with her and Desna. Cut to a shot of a water gun carnival game, using cute caricture cutouts of Aang as targets. Jets of water hit the targets, with the one closest to the camera hitting the hole in the targets mouth, causing Aang's arrow to light up and a cutout of Momo above his head to rise up. Cut to a shot of Mako and Korra from behind as they play the game. Mako is winning and Korra is missing.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Unalaq offered to train me. He says he can teach me about the spirits and my connection to them. <br><b>Mako:</b> Sounds good. What does Tenzin think?     <br><b>Korra:</b> Tenzin thinks I'm his prisoner or one of his kids. I'll never finish training with <i>him</i> in charge.    <br><br><i>(Korra uses waterbending to increase the size and pressure of her water jet. It hits the target full on and makes the Momo cut out quickly reach the top of the meter. Cut to the carnival barker shouting through a megaphone.)</i><br><br><b>Carnival barker:</b> We have a winner!<br><br><i>(Cut to a close up of a plush Appa toy as Korra holds it up.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> I mean, you heard what Unalaq said. The South is spiritually unbalanced and it's the Avatar's job to fix it but my Dad won't even let me think about Unalaq teaching me. <i>(beat)</i> Well? <br><b>Mako:</b> Well, what?     <br><b>Korra:</b> What do you think I should do?    <br><b>Mako:</b> I guess you should do what you think is right. I support whatever decision you make.               <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(sarcastic)</i> Oh... thanks. That's a <i>big</i> help.<br><b>Mako:</b> I thought you wanted me to be supportive. Now you want me to tell you what I think? Make up your mind.          <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(throws the toy into Mako's arms and walks off)</i> Just forget it.<br><br><i>(The scene cuts to a night time shot of several huts with lights on inside near a cliff as snow falls. Cut to a low angle shot of a wind chime hanging over a door. The wind blows it and it chimes softly. Cut to the inside and we see Korra sleeping against Naga. Naga lifts her head up to listen to something, then gets up to go outside. Cut to a close up of Korra looking tired.)</i> <br><br><b>Korra:</b> Ugh. Naga, what are you doing? <i>(Naga starts howling)</i> Naga, hush. <i>(goes outside and sees Naga howling at the cliff's edge. She runs up to Naga and places her hands on Naga's neck)</i> Quiet Naga, you'll wake everyone up.    <br><br><i>(Naga casually licks Korra's face and continues howling. Cut to Mako and Bolin exiting their own huts from below, with Korra and Naga in the background.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> What's going on? <br><br><i>(Cut to a close up of Korra as she turns to look at what Naga is howling over. Cut to a shot from Korra's perspective as a large dark spirit materializes.)</i>  <br><br><b>Korra:</b> What. Is. That?<br><br><i>(The dark spirit suddenly runs towards Korra. It jumps at her from below and kicks her. Mako and Bolin see this and start running to her aid. Korra goes tumbling until she collides with the rocky ledge in front of her hut. The dark spirit's tendrils wrap round her arms and it pins her against the wall while it comes face to face with her. Cut to a close up of Korra and the dark spirit as Korra struggles and it slowly draws closer. Cut to commercial.)</i><br><br><br><br><b><u>Act III</u></b><br><br><i>(Fade in to the close up of Korra and the dark spirit restraining her. She struggles but can't break free. The camera quickly zooms out as the dark spirit begins to open its toothy jaws, just before it is hit with a blast of fire. The spirit drops Korra and turns to its attacker. Cut to a Mako and Bolin running forward. Mako begins punching more blasts of fire while Bolin slides over the ground and begins to bend the earth.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Got it!<br><br><i>(Bolin swings his arm upward and bends a thin wave of rocks aimed at the spirit. The spirit jumps to the side and the rock wave misses. Mako shoots another blast of fire at the spirit, but it dashes out of the way and then dashes at Mako and Bolin.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Don't got it!<br><br><i>(The dark spirit swipes at Mako and Bolin with its tail and knocks them down a hill. Tenzin, Tonraq, and Senna come out of their huts and go to help Mako and Bolin. Cut to Korra as she stands up and runs towards the dark spirit. She jumps and twists her body in the air to perform a vertical tornado kick, firebending a fast arc of flame at the spirit. The spirit dodges again and Korra punches a blast of fire at it, but misses again. The spirit closes the distance and Korra blasts fire at it from close range while jumping back. The spirit jumps into the air and begins falling towards Korra. Cut to the spirit's point of view of Korra as it dives at her. Korra dodges out of the way and the spirit crashes into the snow. Behind Korra we see Tonraq ride towards her and past her on an elevated ice slide.)</i> <br><br><b>Tonraq:</b> Korra!<br><br><i>(Tonraq circles around the spirit and begins bending large ice walls around it to trap it. Tonraq comes to a stop and there's a short moment of silence before the spirit's tendrils burst out of the top of the ice cage. The tendrils violently grab Korra and Tonraq and toss them around. Tonraq hits the front wall of a hut and falls down, while Korra is flung down the hill towards the festival. The spirit breaks out of the ice cage and Tenzin jumps up from below and approaches the dark spirit.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Spirit, why are you angry with us? What have we done to offend you? <br><br><i>(The spirit turns to look at Tenzin for a moment behind swiping its arm at him and knocking Tenzin away. Cut to a far shot and zoom out as we see Tenzin flying away from the spirit and hitting thw snow in the background. In the foreground we see Korra from the back standing up. Cut to a close up of Korra as she inhales deeping and puts her fist into her palm, closing her eyes and entering the Avatar state, her eyes glowing when she opens them. Cut to the spirit as it rushes at Korra. Cut to Korra as the wind kicks up around her and she floats into the air. The dark spirit jumps and dives at Korra, but Korra flies into the sky and out of the way on a thin tornado. The dark spirit bursts through the festival fence and goes skidding over the fair ground before righting itself and coming to a halt. <br><br>Before it has time to act, the dark spirit is hit by a barrage of fire blasts from Korra as she circles around it. The spirit is briefly hidden by a large, orange fire cloud, and then out of its tendrils shoots out from the cloud and snatches Korra. Korra yells in pain before the tendril throws her into a tll stck of wooden crates. Korra is disoriented as she tries to get back up. She looks up as the dark spirit begins to approach her. It raises its harm to attack her but stops as water begins to circle around it. The dark spirit looks to the side, and we cut to Unalaq waving his arms in a circle, bending the water. The water begins to take on a more defined spiraling ring shape around the spirit. Cut to Korra as she watches, and there is a glow. Cut to the now calmed spirit as the water around it starts to emenate a golden glow. Unalq raises his arms over his head, and the dark spirit starts to glow as well. Cut back to Unalaq lowering his arms, then cut to a long, wide shot of the scene as the glowing water rings dissipate and the spirit slowly walks off. Cut to a shot from behind Unalaq as he watches the spirit go.)</i><br><br><b>Unalaq:</b> Go in peace.<br><br><i>(The spirit dissolves into golden specks that fly into the wind. Korra runs up to Unalaq and looks to the spirit She turns as Tonraq and Tenzin run up to them.)</i>   <br><br><b>Tonraq:</b> Korra! <br><b>Tenzin:</b> Are you all right?<br><br><i>(Tonraq puts a hand on Korra's shoulder, but she shrugs it off as she addresses Unalaq.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> How were you able to control that spirit when no one else could?     <br><b>Unalaq:</b> As your father could tell you, I have spent my life studying the spirits and learning their ways. All of this knowledge is lost in the South, but I could teach you everything I know.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> Chief Unalaq, clearly you are <i>very</i> knowledgeable but Korra still has much to learn about airbending, and I hope that going to the Air Temples will help her connect with the past Avatars.<br><b>Korra:</b> Ugh.<br><b>Unalaq:</b> The Air Temples will teach her nothing. Only I can give her the training she needs to be a complete Avatar.      <br><b>Tonraq:</b> I've told you that will not happen.  <br><b>Korra:</b> Hey, I'm right here! Anyone want to ask me what I think?          <br><b>Tenzin:</b> Korra please, listen.  <br><b>Korra:</b> I'm tired of listening to you. Both of you. You keep me locked up, telling me you know what's best but both of you were powerless against the spirit attack. <i>(there is a brief pause as Tenzin and Tonraq glance sadly at each other)</i> I think it's time I had a new teacher.      <br><br><i>(Tenzin closes his eyes and tilts his hed down sadly.)</i><br><br><b>Tonraq:</b> Now, Korra-<br><b>Korra:</b> Unalaq has proven he's the only one who knows what I need to learn. I have to go with him.     <br><b>Tenzin:</b> Please, I know you're angry, but we've come so far together.        <br><b>Korra:</b> I'm sorry, Tenzin. <i>(crosses arms and looks away)</i> This is as far as we go.    <br><br><i>(There is a brief moment as Tenzin lets Korra's response sink in.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> It has been a pleasure serving you, <i>(bows)</i> Avatar Korra.<br><br><i>(Tenzin begins to walk away. Cut to a wide overhead shot and we see the rest of the characters watching from dwn the path. The scene cuts to Tenzin tying up a sack while in the background his family is riding on top of Oogi. He looks up when he hears Katara, and we cut to her with Kya and Bumi on either side of her.)</i>  <br><br><b>Katara:</b> I think you forgot a couple of things.       <br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(blinks)</i> Mother, I think I need some time alone with my family right now. <i>(picks up the sack and turns away)</i>        <br><b>Katara:</b> This is your family, Tenzin. When you get to be my age, you'll be thankful for the time you had with your siblings. Besides, I think it's important that you all visit your father's home together.  <br><br><i>(Tenzin turns back and puts the sack down, just before Bumi walks up and punches his arm and puts an arm around him, followed by Kya.)</i><br><br><b>Bumi:</b> Come on, it'll be fun.    <br><b>Kya:</b> I'm dying to see that laid-back "Vacation Tenzin" I've heard so much about.       <br><b>Tenzin:</b> All right, hop on. <i>(Bumi and Kya walk past him towards Oogi. Tenzin walks up to Katara and they hug)</i> I love you, Mom. We'll see you soon.   <br><br><i>(Cut to a shot of Bumi struggling to climb onto Oogi, with Tenzin's leg in the foreground. Tenzin kicks backwards and sends a gust of air at Bumi, sending him flying upwards and onto the saddle.)</i><br><br><b>Bumi:</b> Oh!<br><br><i>(Cut to a wide shot of the festival ground as Oogi flies away and out of frame. The camera pulls back and pans left to reveal Korra and Mako watching them leave. Cut to a close up of Korra and Mako.)</i>  <br><br><b>Korra:</b> Do you think I did the right thing?   <br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(sighs)</i> I don't know. I'm sorry, but I'm not very good at this Avatar counseling thing. But I know your heart is in the right place, you'll just have to trust it.       <br><br><i>(Cut to a close up of Korra and Mako's hands as Korra takes Mako's hand in hers and they intertwine their fingers. Cut to an extreme close up of Mako as he looks down at his hand, then up at Korra and smiles. Cut to a close up of Korra smiling back. We hear footsteps and Unalaq places his hand on Korra's shoulder. The camera zooms out and pans left to Unalaq.)</i><br><br><b>Unalaq:</b> I know this was a hard decision Korra, but it was the right one. Now it is time to put it behind you and begin your new training. I have great plans for you.  <br><br><br><br>[End Credits]             <br>

When Avatar Korra was attacked by a dark spirit, Chief Unalaq was the only one able to stop it. So Korra turned her back on Tenzin and chose Unalaq as her new spiritual mentor. Tenzin and his family left for a vacation in the Southern Air Temple while Korra remained in the Water Tribe. Will she be able to restore balance between humans and spirits?<br><br><br><br><b><u>Act I</u></b><br><br><i>(The scene begins with a long, wide establishing shot of the Southern Water Tribe and pans down until the tip of a mountain comes into the foreground. A small dark spirit materializes, looking at the town below. Cut to Korra riding Naga towards Unalaq as he exits a large archway. There are supplies on the ground and men tending to arctic camels. Korra dismounts Naga and approached Unalaq.)</i><br><br><b>Unalaq:</b> You're early.         <br><b>Korra:</b> What can I say? I'm pumped up to learn that Unalaq spirit fighting.  <br><b>Unalaq:</b> I'm not here to teach you to fight spirits. I'm here to help you begin your spiritual training. We're going to one of the most remote places in the world, the long neglected spiritual center of your tribe: The South Pole.         <br><b>Korra:</b> You're gonna train me at the South Pole?            <br><b>Unalaq:</b> We will do more than just train. By neglecting the spirits, the people of the South have brought darkness upon themselves and now it threatens to destroy our tribe. We must set things right. The Southern Water Tribe depends on you.         <br><b>Korra:</b> A dangerous trip to the South Pole? Count me in.          <br><br><i>(The scene cuts to a view blocked by clouds. The clouds begin to dissolve and we see an aerial, establishing shot of the Southern Air Temple. Oogi with Tenzin and his family fly into frame.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> There it is, The Southern Air Temple. Isn't it magnificent? <br><br><i>(Cut to a shot from the courtyard of the temple. Air acolytes are sweeping and feeding lemurs as Oogi flies towards them. They notice Oogi, and the camera pans left as the flying bison lands. Someone enters the frame from behind the camera, and we cut to Abbot Shung followed by two other air acolytes carrying boxes. The camera zooms out to show Tenzin helping his children down in the foreground.)</i>     <br><br><b>Abbot Shung:</b> Master Tenzin, welcome.       <br><b>Tenzin:</b> Good to see you again, Abbot Shung.          <br><b>Abbot Shung:</b> Is there anything you need? Water? Dandelion greens? Ah, perhaps you'd like to re-center yourself by meditating in the gardens.         <br><b>Tenzin:</b> No, thank you. I'm fine.               <br><b>Abbot Shung:</b> And you must be the honorable Pema. Please, accept these gifts. This is an ancient airbender head shaver we've refurbished just for you <i>(hands Tenzin an odd looking device resembling metal blades attached to a wire dome with a propeller on top)</i>.          <br><b>Tenzin:</b> Oh... Okay.          <br><b>Abbot Shung:</b> And Pema, these flowers once filled the mountainside. Now they can brighten up your room <i>(gives Pema an enormous bouquet)</i>.     <br><b>Pema:</b> <i>(straining to hold the flowers)</i> That's... sweet? You- you didn't have to.       <br><b>Abbot Shung:</b> Nonsense, whatever you need is yours. Anything for the mother of the next generation of airbenders.         <br><br><i>(The camera zooms out to show an acolyte handing Jinora a book, which Ikki snatches away.)</i><br><br><b>Ikki:</b> No! That gift is mine.    <br><b>Jinora:</b> You don't even like to read.            <br><b>Ikki:</b> <i>(Sticks out her tongue)</i> Naah.             <br><b>Pema:</b> Yep, those are the world's next generation of airbenders. <br><br><i>(Meelo jumps up from behind Shung holding a flying lemur and lands on his shoulders.)</i><br><br><b>Meelo</b> Mommy, Daddy, look. I finally got a lemur. I'm gonna name him Poki. Poki, come back!<br><br><i>(Poki struggles out of Meelo's grasp and flies away. Meelo jumps off of Shung and chases after Poki on an air scooter. The camera pans left and we see Bumi and Kya getting off of Oogi and getting the luggage while a female acolyte sweeps in the foreground. Bumi catches two large sacks and wheezes while Kya slides down.)</i>        <br><br><b>Bumi:</b> Ugh. Phew. Excuse me, a little help here?   <br><b>Air Acolyte woman:</b> Sorry, I thought you were the servants.     <br><b>Bumi:</b> We're Tenzin's brother and sister.       <br><b>Air Acolyte woman:</b> <i>(excited)</i> Avatar Aang had other children?

I'm coming.           <br><b>Unalaq:</b> Absolutely not. You're a distraction to Korra and a hindrance to what needs to be done.       <br><b>Tonraq:</b> My daughter is not going without me. She needs someone to watch after her.       <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(riding on Naga with Mako)</i> Dad, why do you always think you know what's best for me?  <br><b>Unalaq:</b> Because he's misguided. The sad truth is it's men like your father who have put the Spirit World out of balance. He's ignored my warnings in the past and hasn't learned since.       <br><b>Korra:</b> What happened in the past?<br><b>Tonraq:</b> It doesn't matter. What matters is The Everstorm.           <br><b>Mako:</b> The Everstorm?        <br><b>Tonraq:</b> It's a massive blizzard that's battered the South Pole for decades. <i>(turns to Unalaq)</i> I'm coming, unless you think you can stop me. <br><br><i>(The camera cuts to a close up of Unalaq, then Tonraq as they glare at each other.

Still getting used to that throttle.<br><b>Mako:</b> Uh, where'd you get the ride?<br><b>Bolin:</b> Varrick. He's awesome. He also gave me this fancy snowsuit. It's inflatable with an internal heater, emergency beacon, and food ration pouch. I mean, if I get lost, I can survive in this thing for like... like a month. <i>(reaches into his snow suit and pulls out some cucumber-quat slices)</i> Who wants some freeze-dried cucumber-quats? Nobody? Did I interrupt a conversation? <i>(Pabu emerges from the snow suit and snatches the cucumber-quats)</i><br><b>Korra:</b> No, the conversation is over. Dad, come if you want.

There is light and dark in them all. <i>(cut to a shot behind them as we see the Everstorm ahead)</i> But when they're unbalanced, the darkness takes over. If you can open the portal in time, balance will be restored.<br><b>Korra:</b> What do you mean "in time"?              <br><b>Unalaq:</b> There's a reason the Glacier Spirits Festival ends on the Winter Solstice. That's when the Spirit World and the physical world are close together. Only then can the Avatar open the portal.<br><b>Korra:</b> The Winter Solstice is tomorrow.<br><b>Unalaq:</b> Exactly. And we can't afford to wait another year.               <br><br><i>(Cut to a shot from behind some large icicles hanging from a rocky outcropping, with the group in the distance.

I will protect you, my feeble turtle-duck.     <br><b>Bolin:</b> Thank you.          <br><b>Unalaq:</b> Sadly, this isn't a ghost story.

Why he's never taken you to visit his homeland in the North?<br><b>Tonraq:</b> Unalaq, this is not the time.      <br><b>Unalaq:</b> You're right. You should have told her a long time ago.        <br><b>Korra:</b> Told me what?         <br><b>Tonraq:</b> I left the North Pole because...

And the barbarians retreated there because they thought we wouldn't attack on such hallowed grounds. <i>(cut to a close shot of the top of the hill as Tonraq peers over it. He turns to his men and gives them a hand signal. The soldiers split up to flank the barbarians. Cut to an extreme close up of Tonraq as he squints)</i> They thought wrong.<br><br><i>(Cut to the barbarians hiding behind the trees and waiting.

There used to be lights in the South as well but during the hundred year war, the South was thrown out of balance and the lights disappeared.

All three spirits lunge at Mako and Korra, who dodge out of the way, causing the spirits to all collide into each other, forming one large gorilla like spirit. Korra waves her arms in circles and attempts to create a helix of water around the spirit like Unalaq did to calm it. However, the helix lacks form and stability. The spirit appears as if it will glow and be calmed for a moment, but the attempt fails and it rushes at Korra. It swipes at Korra with one of its large arms and knocks her down. It quickly pins Korra arms down and brings its face close to hers, opening its mouth to screech and revealing several rows of sharp teeth. Korra is frozen for a moment as it gets closer, but them the spirit begins to glow and dissolve. Cut to an overhead shot showing Unalaq performing the calming ritual.

Cut to a wide shot from behind of Korra making her way towards the South Pole. Cut to a shot from the side of Korra reaching the edge of the forest. Cut to a shot from inside as Korra enters between two frozen trees. The area is like a network of ice tunnels. Cut to a close up of Korra as she looks around, then to a low shot from behind of her feet as descends a short slope. Tree branches and roots protrude from the ice. Korra continues on away from the camera down the tunnel. Cut to a medium shot of Korra as she makes a turn down a different path, then cut to an overhead shot of her. A dark spirit in the shape of a snake slithers above Korra. Cut to a low shot from behind Korra and tilt up as she turns around at the sound of the spirit's hissing. Cut to Korra's point of view of the path behind her. The camera pulls back and zooms in a moment before two spirit snakes fly towards the camera. Cut to a close up of Korra and briefly zoom out as she gasps and looks surprised. She runs away as the snakes chase after her. They wrap around Korra's legs and trip her. Korra rolls over the ground as the snakes wrap their bodies around her. One snake coils upward and lunges down to bite Korra. Korra raises her fist and shoves it down the snake's throat. The snake's throat swells up a moment before it bursts into flame and is shot back by Korra's fire blast. Korra sits up and does a circular kick with both legs while doing a hand stand, creating a whirlwind with airbending which blows the other snake off her. The two snake spirits regroup and go after Korra again. Korra uses waterbending to push two ice walls out of her way. She jumps between them, then creates a new ice wall which the snakes collide into. Korra stands up as the spirits are trapped on the other side, then slither away. Korra turns around and walks forward. Cut to an overhead shot to show Korra inside a domed area, with an ice floor with a glowing center. Korra walks towards the center.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> The spirit portal. Amazing.                     <br><br><i>(Cut to an overhead shot of Jinora, Ikki, and Meelo asleep in their room, with Ikki and Meelo in one and Jinora in the other.

Cut to a close up from the side of Jinora as she stops and gasps at what is ahead of her. Cut to a shot of the bottom of an old, wooden statue and tilt up to its face. It appears to be a man encircled by a spirit.)</i><br><br><b>Jinora:</b> What Avatar is this? <br><br><i>(The scene cuts to the icy floor above the spirit portal at the south pole. Korra walks forward and we see what appears to be her reflection.)</i>     <br><br><b>Korra:</b> The light in the dark.<br><br><i>(The camera rotates its angle and zooms out to reveal it isn't her reflection, but that the shot is from under the ice and looking up at Korra standing above. Cut to a shot of Korra's feet as she takes a stance. Cut to a low angle shot of her as she raises her arm and punches downward at the floor. A whirlwind forms around her, but there is no effect. Korra blinks for a moment as she gets up, unsure as to why nothing happened. She takes a few steps back and blasts the ice with a large torrent of fire with both hands. She continues the stream of fire for a few seconds before stopping. The dust clears and the ice shows no damage.)</i>     <br><br><b>Korra:</b> Why isn't it opening?<br><br><i>(Cut to a medium shot of Korra. She looks up and gasps as several dozen spirit snakes slither on the outside of the ice dome towards the top. The camera tilts up to the top where the spirits are converging. Cut to a shot from the outside showing the snakes all attempting to break through the ice. Cut to an overhead shot of Korra as she continues to attack the ice floor with air blasts.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Come on, portal. Open!<br><br><i>(Cut to a shot of the snakes breaking through the top of the dome. They merge together into one giant snake, its head poking through the hole in the top. It snarls and quickly moves downward. The giant snake spirit attacks Korra in the back, ensnaring her. Its mouth transforms back into smaller snakes which wrap around Korra. She gasps as we see the bodies of the snakes start to form a net. Korra is lifted up, and she continues trying to break the ice with fire blasts. She is stopped when the spirit snakes wrap around her arms. Korra struggles as she is lifted higher and the spirits continue to tighten their hold on her. Korra grunts and her eyes glow as she enters the Avatar state. She manages to free her arms and falls back towards the floor, but her legs are still trapped and she hangs. The spirits create more tendrils that wrap around Korra while she tries to reach for the portal below. Korra struggles, and manages to tap the floor. A glowing ring ripples out from the center, and the area grows darker, save for the glowing sphere underneath. There is a hum, then the ice cracks, and a pillar of spiritual energy explodes from beneath. Korra is knocked to the side as the dark spirits are hit with the energy. Cut to a long, wide shot of the South Pole and the Everstorm as the pillar of light shoots upward into the storm clouds. It reaches above toward the stars where it splits and forms the Southern Lights, which spread across the sky.

Wha- huh?<br><br><i>(Bolin runs towards Korra and gives her a hug. However, he is separated from her when a wall of ice forms between them, with his head trapped within a groove at the top. He is turned around and the camera pans right as he is made to face Eska, with Desna by her side.)</i>               <br><br><b>Eska:</b> Why are you initiating physical contact with another woman? <br><br><i>(Cut to a close up of Bolin's face as he looks nervous and frightened, gulping and whimpering softly.

By the way, I'm <i>really</i> sorry for being a total pain. Things were really stressful and confusing.

Opposite. <i>(to Zhu Li)</i> Remind me to get the recipe later.<br><b>Tonraq:</b> What's your point, Varrick?  <br><b>Varrick:</b> <i>(piles cookies onto a plate)</i> My point is, Unalaq's already booted our chieftains out of their palace. How long before he starts telling us what kind of cookies we can eat? <i>(flings cookies away)</i><br><b>Zhu Li:</b> Probably a couple of days.<br><b>Varrick:</b> Rhetorical question, Zhu Li, you gotta keep up.

We need to start preparing for war.<br><br><i>(The shot lingers on a close up of Varrick before the scene cuts to a close up of Bolin.

There was a meeting at my parents' house. A lot of Southerners feel like their tribe is being invaded.           <br><b>Unalaq:</b> I am their chief. I'm uniting, not invading.          <br><b>Korra:</b> I know, but I'm just afraid if something doesn't change, there could be a civil war.          <br><b>Unalaq:</b> If the water tribes were at war, the other nations would take sides. The dark spirits would thrive off this negative energy, and the world would be thrown into a battle between spirits and man. That would be catastrophic.<br><b>Korra:</b> How do we stop it?<br><b>Unalaq:</b> We? No, Korra.

They're not welcome here anymore!            <br><b>Northern Soldier:</b> These Southerners need to stay in line.      <br><b>Korra:</b> Everyone, calm down. You're all part of the same tribe. Start acting like it.      <br><b>Southern Waterbender #1:</b> You're taking their side? We thought you were one of us.              <br><b>Korra:</b> I'm not taking anyone's side. <i>(snowball hits her head)</i> Hey!              <br><br><i>(Cut to a shot of a little girl waterbending a snowball from the ground and throwing it at Korra.)</i><br><br><b>Little Girl:</b> You're the worst Avatar ever!<br><br><i>(Korra blocks it with one hand and the snowball immeditely turns into steam. Tonraq's voice is heard, and the camera cuts to a shot of him from behind as he approaches.)</i> <br><br><b>Tonraq:</b> Everyone, walk away from this. They're not worth our trouble. Go back to your homes. <br><br><i>(The Southern waterbenders drop their water and leave. Cut to a shot of Korra and the camera slowly zooms in.

I haven't been spending enough time with them I wish I could be as good a father as Dad was to us.           <br><b>Kya:</b> Tenzin, your problem is you're <i>exactly</i> like Dad. He was so focused on saving the world and doing his duty - don't laugh - that he never had time for us.             <br><b>Tenzin:</b> Dad was under a lot of pressure.          <br><b>Bumi:</b> He always had time for you though, <i>(pinches Tenzin's cheek)</i> his precious little airbender. <br><b>Tenzin:</b> Dad loved us all equally. Besides, it all happened a long time ago. Why are we even talking about this?           <br><b>Kya:</b> Because you seem to have some grandiose delusion that we had a perfect, happy-go-lucky childhood. Guess what? <i>We</i> didn't.              <br><b>Tenzin:</b> We need to keep moving if we want to find Ikki before dark. <i>(continues walking down the trail)</i>          <br><b>Kya:</b> See what he's doing there, Bumi? Classic airbender technique; Cutting and running when things get tough!     <br><b>Tenzin:</b> Ugh.             <br><b>Bumi:</b> Yeah, did Dad teach you that move? <br><br><i>(The scene cuts to a shot of Korra riding Naga over the top of a hill from the front.

The camera zooms out to an over the shoulder shot of Mako.)</i>   <br><br><b>Mako:</b> How was your day, sweetie?  <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(dismounts)</i> Oh, fabulous. My tribe's about to go to war and I'm supposed to stop it, but will anyone listen to me? No! And I didn't ask for my father's help. Can't he just let me be the Avatar?<br><b>Mako:</b> Uh... do you want advice, or am I just supposed to listen? I'm still not clear on that.<br><b>Korra:</b> Ugh. I'm sorry. My Dad just gets me all worked up.<br><b>Mako:</b> How about you take a break from all this Avatar stuff and we go out for a quiet dinner? Just the two of us.       <br><br><i>(Cut to a close up of Korra as she smiles. The shot dissolves into another closeup of Korra, only now she is in a restaurant and frowning.

What happened to ripping off the leech?       <br><b>Bolin:</b> I tried! But anytime I bring up the subject, she threatens to freeze me in a block of ice and feed me to dolphin-piranhas!      <br><b>Mako:</b> So it was more like you tugged at the leech.    <br><b>Bolin:</b> Yes, over and over and over, but it won't come off. Why didn't you warn me your cousin had the power to reach into my heart and crush my soul with her bare hands?<br><b>Korra:</b> Uh... 'cos I thought it was pretty obvious?<br><b>Bolin:</b> No, no, not to me, it wasn't. I'm very bad at reading people. You should know that by now. Oh, man. Oh...

The scene cuts to Tenzin, Kya, and Bumi walking down a path at night, with Tenzin holding a lantern.)</i><br><br><b>Bumi:</b> You know, this reminds me of a search-and-rescue mission I commanded years ago, in the mountains outside of Ba Sing Se.         <br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(sighs)</i> Here we go.           <br><b>Bumi:</b> For five days, we scoured that beast of a mountain, fighting our way through blizzards, sandstorms, and <i>three</i> typhoons. Finally, we found the men huddled in a cave, seconds from death. <i>(music swells, and Tenzin grows more annoyed)</i> With no time to lose, I piled all twelve of those poor souls on my back and single-handedly carried them down the mountain to safety.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> And how exactly is that supposed to help us find Ikki!? <br><br><i>(Kya walks on ahead of her brothers.)</i><br><br><b>Bumi:</b> It was supposed to <i>inspire</i> you. Clearly, you know nothing about being a leader of men. That's probably why the Avatar fired you.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> I'm sick of your far-fetched tales. <i>Three</i> typhoons?         <br><b>Bumi:</b> Well, I may have thrown in an extra typhoon or two for dramatic effect, but-      <br><b>Kya:</b> Quit arguing and bring that lantern over here. I found footprints!       <br><br><i>(Tenzin is surprised for a moment. He jogs over and holds the lantern up.

You're gonna hurt yourself.   <br><b>Bumi:</b> Come on, you wimps! If I can do it, it should be no problem for a couple of benders.    <br><b>Kya:</b> Fine.                  <br><br><i>(Kya jumps into the middle of the waterfall and uses waterbending to slow her descent. Tenzin follows her, hopping along the cliffside and using airbending to slow his descent. Bumi watches them and growls as they reach the bottom far more quickly than him.)</i><br><br><b>Kya:</b> You were right, Bumi! That <i>was</i> faster!        <br><b>Tenzin:</b> At least fifty times faster, by my calculations.          <br><br><i>(Tenzin and Kya both laugh.)</i><br><br><b>Bumi:</b> Oh, Tenzin's the funny guy now.          <br><b>Tenzin:</b> If you need an airlift down, just say the word.          <br><b>Bumi:</b> Bah, I don't need your help. I've got everything under control. Ahh!              <br><br><i>(Bumi slips and falls, hitting and rock and going through tree branches on the way down before landing in the water, making a large splash.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Bumi!<br><br><i>(The scene cuts to Korra riding up to her house on Naga at night.

Korra, what's going on between you two?<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(sits next to Senna)</i> Ask Dad.              <br><b>Senna:</b> I've tried, but he won't talk about it. Honey, it breaks my heart to see our family being torn apart like this.   <br><b>Korra:</b> You want to know what's been going on? I found out Dad's been lying to me my whole life. Unalaq told me everything; How Dad and Tenzin kept me trapped down here while I trained. How dad got banished from the North.<br><b>Senna:</b> So, the truth is out.     <br><b>Korra:</b> You knew. And you never said anything.  <br><b>Senna:</b> We were trying to keep our family together, to give you a <i>normal</i> childhood.       <br><b>Korra:</b> I never wanted a normal childhood. All I ever wanted to be was the Avatar but everyone keeps holding me back, even my own parents! Unalaq's the only one who believes in me.<br><b>Senna:</b> That's not true, Korra.       <br><b>Korra:</b> No? Then why is everyone in the South turning against me, when all I'm trying to do is help them?          <br><b>Senna:</b> The problems between the North and the South started <i>long</i> before you were born. You can't expect to undo them in a day.               <br><b>Korra:</b> So I should just sit back and let the water tribes go to war?              <br><b>Senna:</b> No, but this situation might be out of your control. Varrick's been plotting rebellion against Unalaq. He asked your father to join, and-       <b>Korra:</b> <i>(stands)</i> Dad is part of a rebellion?  <br><b>Senna:</b> I don't know, but I don't want you getting caught in the middle of it.      <br><b>Korra:</b> It's too late, Mom. I'm already in the middle of it.      <br><br><i>(Korra turns and runs outside. She mounts Naga and Senna follows after her.)</i><br><br><b>Senna:</b> Korra!            <br><br><i>(Korra rides off.

I'll tell him I tried to stop you but you escaped. We can still avoid a war.         <br><b>Rebellion Leader:</b> No, we can't.                    <br><br><i>(The leader swings his arms and hammers the floor with his fist, creating an ice wall that travels towards Korra. She rolls to the side, and the wall separates her from the rebels as they make their escape. Korra punches through the ice wall, demolishing it, and chases after them. As the rebels run down the stairs, Korra bends an ice slide onto the railing and grinds down it on her feet. She launches herself off the end of the rails, corkscrewing in midair before landing in front of the rebels.)</i><br><br><b>Rebellion Leader:</b> Get him out of here!     <br><br><i>(The kidnapper runs with Unalaq towards the exit. Korra attempts to chase after him, but another ice wall is bended in front of her, knocking her back a bit.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> We're all part of the same tribe! I don't want to hurt you.                <br><br><i>(The rebels begin flinging water at Korra. Korra dodges to the side and rolls between two pillars. She jumps to avoid another jet of water and grabs a tapestry hanging overhead. Korra runs to the right, avoiding a stream of water that is turned into a large ice crystal. The rebel leader throws more streams of water at Korra, hitting the pillars as she runs behind them. The rebels move in closer to her. Korra runs up the side of a pillar and leaps off, dodging more attacks. The scene goes into slow motion as Korra throws the tapestry over two of the rebels. They stagger off balance a moment before Korra jumps and uses airbending to wrap the tapestry around them, knocking the rebels over. Korra then runs towards the camera and past it as she rushes down the other rebels. The remaining two throw more water at Korra, who does a cartwheel and a flip to avoid it. She lands between them and dodges a punch thrown by the leader as she grabs the lasso on his belt. Korra uses a sidekick to knock back the other rebel as he tries to tackle her. The leader punches twice at Korra, but she weaves out of the way, spinning her body around and wrapping the lasso around his arm. Korra uses the lasso to pull him off balance, then uses his momentum to swing him around in a large circle, throwing him into a pillar and knocking him out. Korra quickly runs around the pillar with the rope, trapping the leader there. Cut to a shot from outside the palace as Korra makes it to the exit. The camera quickly zooms out to show her at the top of a tall flight of stairs.)</i> <br><br><b>Korra:</b> Dad, stop!  <br><br><i>(The kidnapper rides past the camera on a snowmobile, with Unalaq strapped behind him. Korra runs down a few steps before jumping off the side of the stair case. Cut to a shot looking down the street as the snowmobile rides away from the camera. Korra steps into the foreground and waterbends an ice ramp in front of the snowmobile which loops to the side. The kidnapper and Unalaq fall off the snowmobile which crashes into the ground. Korra runs forward. Cut to a shot from the front of Korra as she stops in front of the kidnapper on the ground. The kidnapper groans and begins to sit up, and Korra approaches him.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Why did you do this, Dad? <i>(pulls the kidnapper's mask off to reveal it's not Tonraq)</i> What? Who are you? Where's my father?          <br><b>Kidnapper:</b> He wouldn't help us.

Cut to a close up of a rebel's wrists as handcuffs are placed on them. Cut to a wider shot of the handcuffed kidnappers surrounded by soldiers. The camera pans left to Unalaq and Korra.)</i><br><br><b>Unalaq:</b> Thank you for saving my life.            <br><b>Korra:</b> I'm just glad I got here in time.       <br><b>Unalaq:</b> <i>(to soldiers)</i> Find Varrick. I want him to freeze in prison with the rest of these traitors.<br><br><i>(The leader of the soldiers nods and he and his men leave with the prisoners.)</i>         <br><br><b>Korra:</b> Wait, you can't just lock them away. That will only make the South angrier.          <br><b>Unalaq:</b> You want them to go free?   <br><b>Korra:</b> No... but let them stand trial for what they did. Every Water Tribe citizen deserves that right.      <br><b>Unalaq:</b> Very well.

Deal with <i>that</i>. Ugh!<br><br><i>(Kya raises the healing water above Bumi's head as she turns around and crosses her arms, letting the water drop on his head and soak him.)</i><br><br><b>Kya:</b> Good luck healing yourself with your special non-bending powers.       <br><b>Bumi:</b> <i>(shakes the water off his head)</i> Hey back me up here, Tenzin.             <br><b>Tenzin:</b> Kya's right. You're the oldest of us, but you always acted like the youngest. <i>I</i> had to become the responsible one.<br><b>Kya:</b> You think <i>you're</i> the responsible one?

After Chief Unalaq's troops took over the South, Varrick incited an uprising but Korra stopped the rebels from abducting her uncle. Enraged by the insurrection, Unalaq arrested the rebels and Korra's parents, accusing them of conspiring to assassinate him. Will Korra be able to save her parents and prevent civil war?     <br><br><br><br><b><u>Act I</u></b>    <br><br><i>(The scene opens with a shot of the sky, panning down to an establishing shot of Tonraq's and Senna's igloo and a Water Tribe police van waiting outside. Four Northern soldiers flank the van and the entrance to the igloo. Korra and Unalaq look on as Tonraq, handcuffed, walks himself into the back of the police van. Senna is also handcuffed, and she briefly looks over her shoulder sadly at Korra before following her husband into the van. Korra's expression is equally sad, but also conflicted. She turns to face her uncle as the soldiers shut the doors to the back of the van, get in the front, and drive off.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> You're making a mistake.      <br><b>Unalaq:</b> I wish it hadn't come to this. But your parents held meetings with the rebels, right here in their home.       <br><b>Korra:</b> I can't believe you're doing this to your own family.    <br><b>Unalaq:</b> Rest assured, I've appointed Judge Hotah to oversee the trial. He is the most fair and honorable man I know.       <br><b>Korra:</b> Uncle, my parents had <i>nothing</i> to do with the men who attacked you.           <br><b>Unalaq:</b> I'm sure you're right. So we should have nothing to worry about.         <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(glances away uncertainly)</i> I hope so.<br><br><i>(Cut to a wide, establishing shot of the Southern Water Tribe, with snowy peaks in the background and a tower in the foreground.

He said he needed everyone to think the trial was fair.  <br><b>Korra:</b> So Unalaq told you what to say?          <br><b>Hotah:</b> Yes!

When the flames extinguish in mid-air, he shoots long spears of ice down the corridor at Korra. She deflects one to the side and barely dodges the point of the other one knocking her aside. Mako runs up from behind her and sends a vertical line of fire at Unalaq with a spinning kick in the air. Unalaq dodges to the side and sends a blast of water right into Mako's face, knocking him back. He sends another tentacled blast at Korra, who does a backflip over it as it courses underneath her. Asami is making sure Mako isn't hurt in the background. When Korra lands, she bends a powerful blast of air at Unalaq. Cut to a close-up on Unalaq's surprised expression, before the blast hits him head-on and sends him tumbling down the corridor until he hits the wall at the other end.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> If we get to Varrick's boat, we can still save your father. <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(turns)</i> Let's go!           <br><br><i>(Korra, Asami, and Mako all run away.

After Korra discovered that Chief Unalaq betrayed her and her father, she turned against him, sparking civil war. The Southern Rebels rallied around Tonraq, but they are vastly outnumbered. So Korra is headed to Republic City to seek aid. But will she be able to convince President Raiko to send troops to help the South?         <br><br><br><br><b><u>Act I</u></b> <br><br><i>(The episode opens up to an overhead shot of the docks in Republic City in the day time and the camera slowly zooms in.

The title of the book says, "How to be an Honest Person". Clearly Gang has not read it since his behavior says otherwise.

But the President is refusing to give the order. <i>(Iroh turns away from Korra and puts a hand on his chin in thought)</i> So I decided to come to you directly.    <br><b>Iroh:</b> I see. Well, suppose I were to take the fleet South on some routine training maneuvers. And let's say we were to "accidentally" run into a hostile Northern blockade. <i>(He turns back to Korra)</i> We'd have no choice but to defend ourselves, wouldn't we? <br><b>Korra:</b> I guess you wouldn't.

They're trying to stop supply lines to the South.      <br><b>Lin:</b> I agree. Is there anything else about the attack you remember? Anything unusual?           <br><b>Ship Captain:</b> There is one thing. The bombs exploded in a way I've never seen before, they didn't have fuses. It was like they were being detonated remotely.       <br><br><i>(Cut to Mako as his eyes widen in realization.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Like the bombs at the Cultural Center!<br><b>Asami:</b> Wait, where are you going?      <br><b>Mako:</b> I gotta grab some evidence.         <br><br><i>(Mako wlks past Asami to exit the room just as Varrick enters.)</i> <br><br><b>Varrick:</b> Asami, I heard the news.

I hate them and their <i>stupid</i> mustaches.   <br><b>Asami:</b> Forget them. What's this idea of yours?      <br><b>Mako:</b> A sting operation. I was thinking we'd set up a bait ship, take it out into the open ocean, and capture whoever attacks it.       <br><b>Asami:</b> Let's do it!         <br><b>Mako:</b> It's not that easy. For the plan to work, we need the police, and Bei Fong already said no.            <br><b>Asami:</b> We can make it work, just the two of us.       <br><b>Mako:</b> I don't know.

It's like, a minute ago, when we were shooting, you were into me, but now you're not.<br><b>Ginger:</b> That's because Ginger loves Nuktuk, <i>not</i> Bolin. <i>(walks away)</i><br><b>Bolin:</b> But Nuktuk <i>is</i> Bolin.

He knocks down the Big and Middle brothers, then throws two waves of fire that knocks down two other soldiers. Wan grabs a spear that is thrust at him and uses the soldier's momentum to toss him at the Middle Chou brother before tossing the spear away. Little Chou jumps onto Wan's back, grabbing his head. Wan struggles and creates a ring of fire around him. He throws Little Chou off his back, who takes Wan's mask off as he falls.

Wan throws a fire blast at it, but it splits into two snakes. Wan is disturbed a moment before continuing on. Cut to a shot of Wan from the side, and the spirit snake flies past the camera. Wan throws more fire at it, but misses. It flies by again, and once again Wan attacks it and misses. He flings another fire blast wildly before taking a step back. Wan steps on something squishy and hears a voice, frightening him. Wan holds his fire out to see who is speaking.)</i><br><br><b>Spirit Frog:</b> Hey, watch where you're stepping, human!     <br><b>Wan:</b> Who said that?        <br><b>Spirit Frog:</b> Down here! <i>(Wan looks down.

Wan turns around for a moment to look back, but a giant venus fly trap grabs him. Wan's legs stick out of its mouth, and the rest of him can be seen as a silhouette inside the mouth. Wan struggles to get out, punching the inside of the mouth, then creates a ball of fire, unleashing it inside the mouth, causing it to swell up. The fly trap belches Wan out, along with a large cloud of smoke, and Wan quickly scurries away. <br><br>Cut to a shot of the dark night sky and then tilt down to the tree tops. We see three green tadpole like spirits fly past the camera before it come to ground level. A tiny green spirit with a puffball body, like birdlike legs, and a long beak lands on the ground and jumps off camera. In the background we see Wan run into view and fall down on his back, catching his breath. Cut to a shot of Wan from above as he lies in the grass. He sighs, and then suddenly tendrils sprout from the ground and wrap around Wan. They cover his mouth, and he grunts and struggles as the tendrils pull him under the ground. Cut to the previous shot as Wan goes under, but the ground then erupts in fire. The grass is charred, and Wan frantically climbs out, running away. The camera tilts back up to the sky. <br><br>Dissolve to a shot of the sky in the morning, the sun shining.

Cut to a low angle shot of Wan's lower body from the side as he trudges, then cut to a shot of Wan from the front as he passes by a tree with fungus growing on it and strange purple plants growing by its roots. One of its branches hangs over Wan's path, and on the branch appears to be red fruit, resembling a pitaya. Wan stops and puts a hand to his stomach, hungry, then looks to the fruit. Cut to a close up of the fruit as Wan's hand reaches up and picks it. Cut to a medium close shot of Wan smiling as he brings the fruit to his mouth. Just as he bites it though, the fruit turns out to be a swarm of hornet like insects. Wan is suprised a moment as the hornets swarm around his face, then quickly runs away, swiping at the insects.)</i><br><br><b>Wan:</b> Get off me!

Cut to a shot from the side of Wan falling down the cliff. The camera zooms out as he bounces off a rock and rolls down a concave outcropping and falls further down, grunting in pain. Cut to a shot of Wan sliding down a slope and landing with a thud. Wan rubs the back of his head in pain, then looks up. Cut to an establishing shot of a spirit oasis. It is a rocky island in the middle of a pond, nestled between tall cliffs with waterfall in the background. On the island are fruiting trees and shrubs with berries, and in the middle is a bathing pool. A stone bridge connects to the oasis. Cut to a close up of the yellow fruit hanging from vines on the tree branches. Cut to a close up of Wan as he grins hungrily, stands up and walks forward. Cut to a shot from the side as Wan begins crossing the bridge to the oasis. Suddenly, a tall, aye-aye spirit appears in a blue swirl of light in front of Wan and shoves Wan back with enough force to send him flying back to the other side. The spirit aye-aye crosses his arms.)</i><br><br><b>Spirit Aye-Aye:</b> You are not welcome in my oasis, human.       <br><b>Wan:</b> Please, help me.

Cut to Wan as the Aye-Aye appears behind him, then lifts him up by the shirt)</i> Now, be gone with you!     <br><br><i>(The camera zooms out as the Aye-Aye tosses Wan into a large bush along the path behind them. Wan groans and stumbles out of the bushes as the Spirit Aye-Aye walks back to the oasis. Wan starts to walk away. Cut to a close profile shot of Wan hanging his head sadly. He turns his head towards the camera when he hears the sound of music, then grimaces and steps back.

Wan approaches the Spirit Aye-Aye.)</i><br><br><b>Spirit Aye-Aye:</b> <i>(scrutinizing)</i> And who might you be?     <br><b>Wan:</b> <i>(overly dramtic)</i> I am Bushy, the Bush Spirit.

He turns towards the camera and gives a very big, sheepish grin just before the Spirit Aye-Aye grabs him. The camera quickly zooms out as we see the Aye-Aye throw Wan into the water below the bridge. The other spirits stop to look as Wan lands in the water with a large splash. Cut to a shot of Wan sitting in the water, soaked, as his disguise scatters.)</i>            <br><br><b>Wan:</b> Come on, let me in, just for a little while.    <br><b>Spirit Aye-Aye:</b> No!

Cut to Wan frowning in irritation.)</i><br><br><b>Wan:</b> Real funny. You know what? I don't need your help. I'll find it myself.      <br><br><i>(Wan turns around and walks away, wading through the water. Cut to in front of Wan with the spirits on the bridge in the background. Wan takes a few steps and suddenly falls into a deeper part of the pond, disappearing from view. One of the kind spirits, a tall green one with four arms, a white, mask like face, and leaves for hair, waves goodbye.)</i><br><br><b>Kind Spirit #2:</b> Good luck!               <br><br><i>(Dissolves to a far wide shot of Wan walking through a clearing in the forest and down a small hill.

He looks behind and another fire blast just misses him. Wan skids to a halt, and we cut to a shot of him stopping in front of a small grassy clearing. The hunters run up behind Wan, and Wan leaps over the grass, grabbing a low hanging vine and swinging over. As the first hunter behind him steps into the grass, he sinks down to waist his knees.

Cut to a high angle shot of the spirits as the fire passes between them, separating them for a moment, but Ravaa keeps her hold on Vaatu.)</i><br><br><b>Wan:</b> Stop, or you'll destroy everything!<br><b>Raava:</b> This doesn't concern you, human! <br><br><i>(Vaatu attempts to get away, but Raava grabs him and smashes him into the ground, where they roll on their sides before getting back up.)</i><br>      <br><b>Wan:</b> It does when the lives of spirits and animals are in danger!         <br><b>Vaatu:</b> If you're a friend to spirits, then use your fire to help me break free!           <br><b>Raava:</b> Don't involve the human. This is between us.       <br><b>Vaatu:</b> <i>Please</i>, save me. She has tormented me for <i>10,000 years</i>.           <br><b>Wan:</b> 10,000 years? <i>(looks to the side to think for a second before looking back)</i> Let him go!           <br><br><i>(Wan throws his hand forward. Cut to a shot from behind as he releases another stream of fire at the spirits. Some of Ravaa's tendrils let go of Vaatu, but their tails remain tangled. Raava swipes at Wan, throwing him past some bushes in the background. While Ravaa is distracted, Vaatu attempts to pull away, but Raava holds on tight. Cut to Wan emerging from the bushes, rubbing his head. He looks up worriedly. Cut to a shot of Vaatu swiping at Raava, pushing her back. Cut to a close up of the tips of Ravaa and Vaatu's tails coiled around each other, Ravaa barely hanging on to Vaatu. Cut to a close up of Wan as he sees this. He frowns with determination. The camera quickly zooms out from Wan as he does a short jump, turning in the air and bringing his arm swinging down diagonally as he shoots out an arc of flame at the camera. Cut to a shot of the spirits as a bright light shines from where Wan's fire struck their tails, followed by a burst. Vaatu and Raava separate, with Raava screaming in pain as she collapses. She begins to shrink, and Vaatu flies to the top of a nearby mountain while Wan watches in the foreground.)</i><br><br><b>Vaatu:</b> Thank you, human. You have performed a great service for the spirits.<br><br><i>(Vaatu flies off behind the mountain, and Mula walks up to Wan, looking at Raava. Cut to a shot of Wan and Mula, with Wan looking worried.)</i><br><br><b>Raava:</b> Do you realize what you've done?<br><b>Wan:</b> Yeah, I helped a spirit who was being bullied by you!  <br><b>Raava:</b> You are <i>gravely mistaken</i>. I was keeping him <i>under control</i>.         <br><b>Wan:</b> And what gives you the right?              <br><b>Raava:</b> You don't even know who I am, do you?             <br><b>Wan:</b> Should I?           <br><b>Raava:</b> Yes. My name is Raava. That spirit you freed is Vaatu. He is the force of darkness and chaos. I am the force of light and peace. Since the beginning of time, we have battled over the fate of this world. And for the past 10,000 years, I have kept darkness under control and the world in balance, until you came along.      <br><b>Wan:</b> So by freeing Vaatu, I let chaos into the world?         <br><b>Raava:</b> Precisely. The human and spirit realms are headed toward annihilation, and it's all your fault!    <br><br><i>(Cut to an extreme close up of Wan's profile as he looks at Ravaa. He tilts his head down as he realizes the weight of his actions.

We see the fire sages standing around the edge and looking down at Korra.)</i><br><br><b>Karu:</b> Should we pull her up?    <br><b>Shaman:</b> No. She is connecting with her deepest Avatar memories. She must confront her own past if she is to move forward. <i>(cut to close up of Korra and zoom in)</i> We can only hope that she survives her ordeal.  <br><br><i>(Korra's closed eyelids twitch a moment and they suddenly open. The scene changes to within Korra's consciousness as she turns glowing purple and floats back from the camera. She hears Ravaa speaking, and we cut behind Korra as she turns around. Pink petals blow pst Korra as the camera pans around her and we see a window into the past, where Ravaa is speaking to Wan, with Mula at his side.)</i><br><br><b>Raava:</b> The human and spirit realms are headed toward annihilation, and it's all your fault! <i>This</i> is why humans have no place interfering in the business of spirits.           <br><br><i>(The camera zooms in on Wan and Ravaa until Korra is out of frame. Cut to a close up of Wan.)</i><br><br><b>Wan:</b> This world is home to all of us, and what happens here is everyone's business.     <br><b>Raava:</b> Thanks to you, this world may cease to exist!

Mula makes a soft growl, and stops as they both listen to the sound of leaves rustling. The camera quickly pans right to a tree top. It is bearing fruit and shakes for a moment. Cut to a medium shot of Wan and Mula pushing past some foliage and looking to see what made the noise. Cut to a shot of what appears to be four air nomads, wearing red and yellow robes, each carrying a large basket. Instead of arrows. Their blue tattoos resemble the fur pattern of a Lion Turtle rather than arrows. Two of the nomads concentrate, and they create small clouds under their feet. The nomads ride the clouds up to the tree branches, where we see another one. Cut to a close up of one nomad picking a fruit and putting it in his basket as the camera zooms out to show the other two doing the same.

I'm friendly!      <br><br><i>(Wan rides after the nomads. Cut to the nomads approaching a large bush. Three of them leap over it, leaving a wind trail, while two go through it. Wan rides past the camera and through the bush. Cut to a side shot of Wan riding through the forest. Mula skids to a stop as the camera zooms out to show a cliff in front of them. Wan is thrown off Mula's back and catches a branch growing out of the side of the cliff. He is sprung back up a moment and then desperately hugs one of the leafy branches. Cut to an overhead shot as Wan looks down below. The ground is hidden by white mist. Wan begins to climb up. Cut to a close up of the edge of the cliff as Wan climbs back up into view, leaves a twigs in his hair. He grunts and sighs in relief before he is once again frightened.)</i> <br><br><b>Wan:</b> Huh?<br><br><i>(Cut to Wan's point of view as a nomad runs past Mula and right towards him. Cut to a shot from the side as the nomad jumps over Wan and creates a cloud under his feet as he begins to glide, as if surfing the air. Cut to an extreme far shot as we see the nomad gliding towards what looks like a large, hilly island floating upward. Cut to Wan standing back up with Mula behind him as he looks at the floating island. Cut to a shot from behind Wan as he sees that the island is a flying Lion Turtle.)</i><br> <br><b>Wan:</b> The legends are true! Another Lion Turtle city. And it's flying! <i>(cut to the extreme far shot showing the Lion Turtle floating in mid air. The nomads can be seen standing on its right paw.

Cut to a close up of Wan as he grins)</i> I have got to get over there.  <br><br><i>(Cut to a close up of a vine pulling down a tree branch. Cut to a further shot as we see Mula pulling the vine around a large rock, which bends down the small tree it is attached to. Wan watches and takes the vine from Mula, tying it around the rock tightly and then testing its tension.)</i> <br><br><b>Wan:</b> There. <i>(climbs onto the bent tree and sits on it)</i> Okay, Mula. Wish me luck. <i>(shoots a flame at the vine, burning it. The release of tensions makes the tree snap back up straight and propels Wan through the air. Cut to the extreme far shot of the Lion Turtle as Wan flies towards it. Cut to a shot of Wan flying at the camera, flinging his arms forward and yelling in fright. Cut to a shot from the side with the camera following Wan as he misses the Lion Turtle's shell)</i> Oh, no-                     <br><br><i>(Wan instead grabs a hold of one of several vines hanging from the Lion Turtle. He swings a moment and regains his compsure, sighing in relief. Dissolve to an overhead shot of the top of the Lion Turtle, the camera panning up to show several grass huts and rock gardens amongst bonzai trees and small bushes. Some of the grass huts are a few stories tall. Cut to an overhead shot of Wan walking down a dirt path between several huts, passing by the residents of the village. Cut to a low angle close shot of Wan as he looks around. He stops and steps back as a green transparent bird-like spirit flies in front of him. Wan smiles as he watches it go past him.)</i><br><br><b>Wan:</b> Wow. <br><br><i>(Cut to a shot from the side of three nomads meditating under a tree as the spirit flies past them and lands on a branch. A green puffy spirit with bird-like legs and a beak hops on a nomad's shoulder, and the camera pans left as Wan approches.)</i> <br><br><b>Wan:</b> Hi, how are you? I'm Wan. I'm sorry to interrupt, but it's been a while since I've seen other humans.  <br><b>Male Nomad:</b> Where did you come from, stranger?               <br><b>Wan:</b> Another Lion Turtle city far away. For the past two years, I've been living among the spirits and exploring the wilds.    <br><b>Male Nomad:</b> Remarkable. Come. Sit with us. We would love to hear of your travels.        <br><br><i>(The puffy green spirit on the nomad's shoulder suddenly turns into a dark spirit. It hisses and leaps at Wan, who ducks under to avoid it. The camera pans to the right as the spirit runs off, and we see a strange spirit sitting on the roof of a hut. It turns into a dark spirit as well, and rips a hole in the roof before going inside it. The occupants of the hut, a man and woman, run out yelling in fright as the dark spirit chases them out and goes after the woman towards the left. Cut to a shot of two boys playing around a large lizard spirit and a plant-bear spirit. The lizard spirit turns dark and chases off one boy, then the plant bear spirit turns dark and chases off the other. Cut to an overhead shot of the village as dark spirits run amok, terrorizing the people. One dark spirit flies close in front of the camera and leaves just before the huge shadow of Vaatu looms over the village. Cut to a shot of Wan and the three nomads looking up at Vaatu towering over them. Cut to a high angle close up of Wan as he looks surprised, then frowns in anger.)</i><br><br><b>Wan:</b> Vaatu.            <br><b>Vaatu:</b> So we meet again, human.      <br><b>Male Nomad:</b> Why is the great spirit of darkness here but not his other half?     <br><b>Wan:</b> <i>(nervously)</i> Uh, I'll explain later. <i>(runs to the middle of the village amidst the panicking people)</i> Leave these people in peace. They've done nothing to harm you.          <br><br><i>(Wan ducks as an eel-like dark spirit flies past him. Cut to a shot of a mother and child cowering outside a hut as the shadow of the dark spirit approaches them, holding each other and looking away in fright. Cut to an over the shoulder shot of the dark spirit as it slowly draws near, only to be blasted by fire from Wan. Cut to a shot of several dark spirits, their attention now turned to Wan, and they all fly towards him. Cut to a shot of Wan readying himself, and he attacks each spirit that approaches him with fire. He does a high roundhouse kick and sends waves of fire at two dark spirits in a tree and on a ledge above him. The spirits jump out of the way. Cut to a shot of a man, woman, and child being surrounded by dark spirits. As one approaches, Wan blasts it back, and then another one. Cut to a close up of Wan as the spirit's body dissolves in front of him. Cut to a shot of Raava rising from a bush, then quickly flying past the camera. Cut to a low angle shot of Vaatu as he begins to rise above Wan and the villagers, only for Raava to ram into him and knock him away.)</i><br><br><b>Raava:</b> Be gone.  <br><br><i>(Raava and Vaatu go flying into the bushes. Cut to a close up of Wan smiling. Cut to a high angle shot of Wan as the villagers as the circle of dark spirits around them move in. Raava swoops down from above and flies around the humans in a circle, blowing away the dark spirits. Cut to an over the shoulder shot of Raava and Wan looking up at Vaatu flying back towards them.)</i>            <br><br><b>Vaatu:</b> How are you feeling since our split, Raava? I've never been better. When Harmonic Convergence comes, I will destroy you <i>forever</i>.   <br><br><i>(Vaatu and the dark spirits fly away into the sky. Cut to a shot in front of Wan and Raava, with the family standing behind them. Wan sighs and hangs his head in exhaustion as Raava turns to him.)</i><br><br><b>Raava:</b> I told you <i>not</i> to interfere! <br><b>Wan:</b> I had to do something. These people were in danger.  <br><b>Male Nomad:</b> <i>(approaching)</i> Great spirit of Light, we thank you for your help. But how did you become split from Vaatu? <i>(Wan winces)</i>          <br><b>Raava:</b> Ask <i>him</i>.              <br><b>Wan:</b> <i>(turns to the nomad and hesitates nervously)</i> It wasn't my fault. Vaatu tricked me into freeing him. I'd take it all back if I could.           <br><b>Raava:</b> It's too late for that. Now that Vaatu is free, he is turning other spirits dark. The more spirits he turns, the stronger he becomes.    <br><b>Wan:</b> He's getting bigger, and you're getting smaller.   <br><b>Raava:</b> As darkness grows, light fades.          <br><b>Wan:</b> I'm sorry for endangering your village, but I promise to set things right.      <br><b>Male Nomad:</b> <i>(turns to look at another nomad, worried)</i> How?             <br><br><i>(Cut to an extreme far side shot of the Air Lion Turtle as it faces Wan, Raava, Mula, and a nomad standing on a cliff.)</i><br><br><b>Wan:</b> Great Lion Turtle, I ask that you grant me the power of air so that I can defeat Vaatu before it's too late.      <br><b>Air Lion Turtle:</b> You already carry the power of fire. No human has ever held two elements at the same time. <br><b>Wan:</b> I'm not like other humans. I can learn to do it.      <br><b>Air Lion Turtle:</b> Hmm, perhaps. But to do so, Raava must hold the power for you until you master it.      <br><b>Raava:</b> Ancient one, why would I do that for a <i>human</i>? Especially one who's caused so much trouble?        <br><b>Wan:</b> Raava, please, I can't let the world fall into chaos because of my mistake. Neither of us can defeat Vaatu alone, but together we have a chance.           <br><b>Raava:</b> You may be right. Very well. I will help you to master the power of air.           <br><b>Wan:</b> Thank you. And in return, I will help you restore balance to the world.          <br><br><i>(Slowly zoom in on a high angle close up of Wan. Cut to commercial.)</i><br><br><br><br><u><b>Act II</b></u><br><br><i>(Fade into a far shot of Wan riding Mula alingside Raava as they climb over the top of a hill.)</i> <br><br><b>Wan:</b> What's this Harmonic thing Vaatu was talking about?    <br><b>Raava:</b> Harmonic Convergence. That is when Vaatu and I must battle for the fate of the world.      <br><b>Wan:</b> How long do we have until then?           <br><b>Raava:</b> About a year in your time.          <br><b>Wan:</b> Then we better start training. <br><br><i>(Cut to a high angle shot of them and the camera pans up past a misty mountain range. Dissolve to a shot at dusk of Wan and Raava standing near a volcano with streams of lava pouring around it. Mula sits nearby. Wan practices a few firebending moves and turns to Raava.)</i>      <br><br><b>Wan:</b> All right, I'm ready to try air. How's this gonna work?<br><b>Raava:</b> The only way for me to give you the other element is to pass through your body and combine our energies.       <br><b>Wan:</b> Great. So you've done this before.   <br><b>Raava:</b> No. This has never even been attempted. It is very dangerous.      <br><b>Wan:</b> That's what they said about living in the Spirit Wilds, and I survived that. I'm ready. Give me the air. <br><br><i>(The camera follows Raava as she flies up into the air, twists around a few times, and then flies through Wan's chest. Cut to a close medium shot of Wan as Raava passes through him. Wan cries out in pain as a bright swirling light shines from his chest while Raava flies through him. Wan crumples to his knees and hangs his head. Cut to a close up of Wan from the side of his head and he catches his breath. Cut to a shot of Wan standing up as Raava lands next to him. Wan looks at his hands a second before he thrusts his palm forward. Just as he does so, a gust of air shoots out from it, and the camera cuts to a farther distance to show the size of it.)</i><br><br><b>Wan:</b> It feels completely different. If you and Vaatu have the same fight every 10,000 years, why hasn't one of you destroyed the other? <i>(practices a double palm thrusts and shoots out an even larger gust)</i>   <br><b>Raava:</b> He cannot destroy light any more than I can destroy darkness. One cannot exist without the other. <i>(Wan does a high side kick and shoots out a gust)</i> Even if I defeat Vaatu in this encounter, darkness will grow inside me until he emerges again. The same will hold true if Vaatu defeats me.      <br><b>Wan:</b> That doesn't sound so bad. Even if Vaatu wins, you'll come back.           <br><b>Raava:</b> Yes, but you will probably not survive to see it. Vaatu will destroy the world as you know it. Darkness will cover the earth for 10,000 years.           <br><b>Wan:</b> If I'm gonna help you battle Vaatu, then I should visit more lion turtles.          <br><br><i>(Dissolve to a high angle establishing shot of misty mountain ranges. The camera pans up to show a lion turtle sitting in a large body of water. A bright glimmer can be seen coming from its claw tip. Cut to a close side shot of Wan as he is given the power of Water.)</i><br><br><b>Wan:</b> <i>(voice over)</i> Why is there so much conflict between humans and spirits in the first place?<br><br><i>(The Water Lion Turtle pulls its claw away. The camera slowly zooms out as Wan lifts his hand and bends up flowing water from below.)</i>       <br><br><b>Raava:</b> <i>(voice over)</i> This physical world is where humans come from. Spirits come from another realm. <i>(dissolve to a far establishing shot of a desert with a few high sandstone buttes in the background. The Earth Lion Turtle is seen rising out of the ground to the right, making the ground shake and throwing dust everywhere.)</i> At the North and South poles, the two realms intersect. Over time, more and more spirits have drifted into this world. <i>(Cut to a low angle shot of the Earth Lion Turtle's face as it looks down at Wan on Mula and Raava, sand pouring over it's nose and eyebrows. Cut to a far shot of the lion turtle giving Wan the power of Earth.)</i> Humans have been forced apart, settling on the lion turtles who protect them, and losing touch with each other.        <br><br><i>(Cut to a close up of Wan in a forest as leaves blow past his face as he turns to the camera. The camera pulls back and pans around Wan as he begins to practice water bending.)</i> <br><br><b>Wan:</b> <i>(voice over)</i> Most people think they live in the only human city in the world.          <br><b>Raava:</b> <i>(voice over)</i> Most humans think only of themselves, no matter how many others are around.   <br><br><i>(Wan bends the water away and Raava passes through him. Wan grunts in pain. Cut to a low angle close shot of Wan as he clenches his fists.)</i><br><br><b>Wan:</b> When you pass through me, I feel an incredible rush of power. <i>(readies himself, then bends up a large, sharp rock from the ground before breaking the top part off with a punch and sending it flying. Wan stomps the ground to pop up the bottom half, then kicks it away. Raava psses through him again)</i> I feel like I'm changing. The more we practice, the stronger I become. <i>(sniffs the air. Raava and Mula also bring their attention to the smell)</i> Smells like smoke.          <br><b>Raava:</b> Humans are nearby.      <br><b>Wan:</b> Let's check it out.      <br><br><i>(Cut to a shot of Wan riding Mula to the top of a small hill and dismounting.

Wan?              <br><b>Wan:</b> Jaya! <i>(they hug)</i> What are you doing out here?  <br><b>Jaya:</b> Ha ha! You inspired us. Once we heard that you survived out in the wilds, we decided to try it too.       <br><b>Wan:</b> Where's Yao? Did he come with you?      <br><b>Jaya:</b> Yes, but sadly, he didn't make it. We- we lost a lot of good men along the way. <i>(Raava comes up next to Wan)</i> So why were you protecting this spirit?          <br><b>Wan:</b> This is Raava. Don't worry, she's not like the dark spirits you've probably run into.       <br><b>Jaya:</b> Dark spirits? What's the difference? We throw fire at any spirit we see around here. Just like they attack any man. <br><b>Raava:</b> You have no idea what you're doing! You're only making things worse!     <br><b>Settler:</b> The spirits are coming back! <br><br><i>(Cut to a high angle shot as the settlers around to look.

When did you become so violent?          <br><b>Jaya:</b> You showed me we could change the world if we just stopped being so afraid.

Wan leaps into the air, surrounded by the four elements. Cut to a wide shot as Wan rises into the air on a small tornado. Fire, earth, and water surround him in large rings as the wind whips around him. Cut to a close shot of him.)</i> Enough!

A dust cloud covers the camera's view, and the scene fades to white as the sounds of battle quickly fade out. Fade in to a close up of Wan's face as he lays down unconscious. He groans as he opens his eyes. Cut to a far wide shot looking down from the edge of a cliff at the burning forest below, black smoke rising from it. The camera zooms out and we see Wan stand up and looks down as Mula walks into view from the left.)</i> <br><br><b>Wan:</b> We have to go back.       <br><br><i>(Vaatu suddenly rises from below the cliff in front of Wan, now even larger than before.)</i><br><br><b>Vaatu:</b> Don't bother.

The camera zoom in between the tips of two mountain in the foreground and cuts to a high angle shot of Wan from behind as he rides towards the Southern spirit portal in the distance, a pillar of blue swirling energy shooting up into the sky. Wan is wearing a scarf as a hood. Cut to a slightly low angle shot of Wan from the front and we see him holding the teapot Raava is resting in, her light shining from the open top.)</i><br><br><b>Raava:</b> We're almost there. I was wrong about you, Wan. I had no idea that humans were capable of such nobility and courage. I'm sorry that we do not have much more time together.    <br><b>Wan:</b> Let's not give up before the battle's even begun. Who knows what will happen? After all, this is my first Harmonic Convergence. <br><br><i>(Cut to a high angle shot of some tree tops and pan up to the spirit portal as Wan rides towards it from below.)</i><br><br><b>Raava:</b> This is the Southern portal to the Spirit World. Here, Vaatu and I will do battle once again at the place where the two worlds meet.<br><br><i>(Cut to a shot from the side as Wan rides Mula into the portal. They glow white as they are engulfed by the energy, and the scene dissolves into the spirit world as they exit the other side. Cut to a shot in front of Wan and Mula as Wan puts his hood down. Cut to a shot from behind them as we see the area in spirit world. The ground is covered in short jagged rocks, surrounded by steep, pointy hills. The sky is covered in swirling clouds of various shades of blue in green. A giant, gnarled tree with a large, eye shaped hole in its trunk stands in the center of the area, and on the other side can be seen the Northern portal as its golden energy shoots into the sky. Cut to a high angle extreme far shot of the area, and we see that the jagged rocks form swirling patterns around the two portals, which together create a giant yin-yang on the ground. Between the lines of rocks are streams of water, and a forest surrounds the area outside the yin-yang. Cut to the pervious shot from behind Wan as we see Vatu emerge from the Northern portal. He flies towards Wan and lands in front of him. Vaatu's long tendrils writhe around him.)</i>     <br><br><b>Vaatu:</b> Are you ready for our final battle, Raava? Thanks to our friend separating us, I think this time, I may be rid of you once and for all.           <br><br><i>(Wan dismounts Mula and places Raava on Mula's saddle before he takes a few steps towards Vaatu, determined.)</i><br><br><b>Wan:</b> Before you get to her, you'll have to go through me.<br><b>Vaatu:</b> <i>(mused)</i> No human can stand against me.      <br><b>Wan:</b> Haven't you heard the legends?

Vaatu deflects the fire with a tendril, but Wan continues the attack. Vaatu ducks under Wan's second fire blast and goes to fly over and past Wan. Wan shoots a third blast that grazes Vaatu. Cut to a close shot of Wan as he keeps shooting fire as Vaatu flies around him, shooting a large blast past the camera. Cut to Vaatu as he swoops around, dodging the attacks, and flies towards the camera. Mula runs away as Vaatu closes in on Wan. Vaatu makes a hard stop and uses his momentum to whip Wan with his tail. Wan is sent flying and yells in pain before he goes skidding over the ground. Vaatu flies fter him and lands in front of Wan as he gets on his hands and knees.)</i><br><br><b>Vaatu:</b> I lived 10,000 lifetimes before <i>the first of your kind crawled out</i> of the mud.    <br><br><i>(Cut to a close shot of Wan as he looks up at Vaatu nervously. Cut to Vaatu as he rears back. The orange-red pattern on his body glows with purple fire and he shoots huge a purple beam of energy from his eye. The beam rakes across the ground, tearing it up before it hits Wan and sends him flying back once more. Wan groans in pain and skids over the ground near a stream of water, back on his hands and knees as Vaatu swoops around him.)</i><br><br><b>Vaatu:</b> It was I who broke through the divide that separated the plane of spirits from the material world!    <br><br><i>(Vaatu shoots another energy beam at Wan. Wan bounces and rolls over the ground helplessly. He stops on his side, and we cut to a close shot of him as he trembles in pain. Wan slowly pushes himself up and steels his resolve, glaring upward with determination.)</i><br><br><b>Vaatu:</b> To hate me is to give me breath, to fight me is to give me strength. Now prepare to face oblivion!           <br><br><i>(Cut to a low angle shot from behind Wan as Vaatu flies in front of him, towering above Wan as he readies another energy beam. Cut to Wan quickly getting back on his feet. He shoots two blasts of fire from his fists down at the ground and uses them to boost himself as he leaps away, barely avoiding Vaatu's attack. Wan shoots the ground as he lands to cuchion his fall, but stumbles and rolls. He tries to get back to his feet, but cluches his side in pain and falls back to his hands and knees. Cut to a close up of Wan as he grits his teeth and reaches out with one hand.)</i><br><br><b>Wan:</b> Raava! The only way to win is together.                     <br><br><i>(Cut to a shot of Raava peeking out from the teapot as it sits on Mula. Raava flies out of the teapot and towards the camera. The camera zooms out to show Wan standing up. Cut to a shot from the side as Raava enters Wan's body with a small flash of light. Wan groans in pain and falls to one knee before his body glows with white energy. He looks up as Vaatu closes in. Wan cartwheels and then jumps to the side to dodge a tendril strike aimed at him. Wan lands on the ground and forms a cloud under his feet with airbending and rides it, using it to quickly escape another tendril strike as Vaatu chases him. Wan flies on the cloud, banking left and right to avoid more tendril whips. One last whip strikes the cloud and dissipates it, sending Wan into the air. Wan turns around in mid air and shoots a large blast of fire back at Vaatu, which strikes the evil spirit in the center. Vaatu recoils and twists his body a moment before continuing the chase. Wan hits the ground and starts rolling backwards before righting himself as Vaatu draws closer, sliding over the ground. Cut to the side as Wan steadies himself, and the camera quickly zooms out as Wan uses earthbending to propel himself upward from a large slab of rock at Vaatu. Wan lets out a battle cry as he corskews in the air and lets loose an arc of fire, but Vaatu knocks him away with a tendril. The fire strikes Vaatu and cuts through him and Wan lands, skidding over the ground. He forms a cloud under his feet and floats on it as he spins his body around and bends water from a nearby stream, sending three torrents of water at Vaatu. The water strikes Vaatu, knocking him back a moment and destroying a part of his body which is quickly regenerated. Wan flies back a moment before launching himself upward and earthbending three boulders with him. Wan and Vaatu circle each other a moment before Wan tosses a boulder at Vaatu, which the spirit ducks under, but is hit by the second one thrown. Wan flies higher and throws the third boulder, which Vaatu barrel rolls around. Vaatu swipes at Wan, but Wan quickly flies around him. Vaatu whips at Wan's cloud and destroys it, sending Wan falling. Wan forms another cloud under his feet to slow his descent and fly away, and he shoots fire at Vaatu as the spirit approaches, hitting the swooping spirit twice. Wan slides to a stop and falls to his hands and knees once more, grimacing in pain as his body vibrates with energy like static electricity.)</i><br><br><b>Raava:</b> I have to leave you. If I stay any longer, you will die.          <br><b>Wan:</b> <i>(in pain)</i> It doesn't matter. If you leave me now, Vaatu will destroy everything. We have to finish this together!               <br><br><i>(Wan leaps forward and begins to ride on a cloud, racing towards Vaatu. Vaatu glows with power and shoots an energy beam which Wan evades by jumping from the cloud, somersaulting over Vaatu and blasting him with fire from behind, catching Vaatu on fire. Wan lands on his feet, but falls to his knees as Raava's power takes its toll on him. Vaatu swoops around and spins, throwing a tendril out which knocks Wan back. The tendril wraps around Wan's waist and reels him back in. Vaatu slams Wan into the ground as he drags him back, then tosses Wan into the air and shoots him with an energy beam. Wan yells in pain as he goes flying back, rolling and bouncing over the ground and coming to a stop at the edge of the Southern portal. Wan tries to get up, but Vaatu quickly closes in and uses a tendril to pin Wan down against the side of the portal. Wan grunts in pain and looks up at Vaatu.)</i><br><br><b>Vaatu:</b> The Harmonic Convergence is about to begin. The era of Raava is over.<br><br><i>(Cut to a shot of eight planets aligning, silhouetted against an enormous, blazing sun. Cut to an extreme wide shot from the side of the spirit world. The two portals on either side begin to surge with power, and their beams of light bend toward each other until they connect as one large arc with a flash of light at the top. Lightning crackles from the joined portals. Cut to a high angle shot of Vaatu looking up, with Wan still pinned down below him. Vaatu glows with energy as the Harmonic Convergence begins.

The energy begins to envelop his arm. Cut to a close shot of Wan as his arm starts turning light blue and it spreads to the rest of his body. Vaatu removes his tendril from Wan and grunts in surprise as Wan looks up. The camera pans up to Vaatu as he turns to face Wan.

Wan begins to swing his arms in large circles, and we cut to behind him to see Wan bending the elements at Vaatu, first a rock, then a stream of water, then an arc of fire that cuts Vaatu. Wan makes a spear hand and thrusts it forward before raising it and earthbending an enormous rock which strikes Vaatu, knocking the spirit away. Wan pauses a moment before spinning his body around and airbending a jetstream at Vaatu. The stream of air begins to surround the spirit and forms a large bubble around him. Wan turns his body again and bends several rocks at Vatu, which form a diagonal ring around him, along with a diagonal ring of air forming. Wan then spins backwards and swings both arms forward to send two streams of water at Vaatu, which form a horizontal water ring around Vaatu. Lastly, Wan does a forward flip kick and bends an arc of fire, which forms a vertical ring of fire around Vaatu. Cut to Wan's front as he raises his hands and begins to push the now imprisoned Vaatu towards the large tree. Once close, Wan thrusts his hand and shoots a gust of air at Vaatu, pushing him through the hole in the tree and inside the hollow trunk. Vaatu's prison glowls brightly, then unleashes a circular wave of energy. Cut to an extreme wide shot of the area as the energy wave spreads across it, then dissipates. Cut to a shot from behind Wan as he looks at Vaatu imprisoned in a forcefield of energy within the tree.)</i>    <br><br><b>Wan:</b> This is your prison now. And I will close the portal so no human will ever be able to physically enter the Spirit World and release you. <br><br><i>(Wan turns around and walks away. Dissolve to a wide side shot of Wan touching the Northern spirit portal, with Mula behind him. The beam of light begins to shrink, and the opening becomes covered in a dome of swirling purple energy. Cut to an extreme wide shot of the area as the arc of light is broken and the beam from the Southern portal straightens back up. Cut to a shot of a line of spirits and pan left to see them walking towards the Southern spirit portal far in the distance in the material world. We see a few more long lines of spirits also heading for the portal, and some spirits fly overhead.)</i> <br><br><b>Wan:</b> The spirits must stop fighting with humans and return to their home in the Spirit World.

The camera pulls back, the arrows sticking up in the foreground. Wan tilts his head back, closes his eyes, and breathes his last breath. As he does so, a bright golden trail of spiritual energy, Wan's soul, escapes from his mouth. The camera follows the soul as it floats into the air for a moment, and dissolves in the wind. The camera tilts up to the dark sky as the golden particles disappear, then fades to white. The sound of a newborn baby crying is heard. The scene fades into an extreme close up of Korra's closed eyes. She suddenly opens them and they glow white.

No.               <br><b>Asami:</b> He attacked his own ship?   <br><b>Mako:</b> Yes! It was a ploy. He wants Republic City to go to war, and he wants control of the businesses that stand to profit the most from it. He already had all the shipping. All he needed was Future Industries.     <br><b>Asami:</b> Varrick helped <i>save</i> Future Industries. He's my business partner now, not an evil mastermind. Mako, you seem stressed.    <br><b>Mako:</b> I <i>am</i> stressed!        <br><b>Bolin:</b> See, this is why I had to move out.          <br><b>Asami:</b> You guys aren't living together anymore?    <br><b>Bolin:</b> Nope.

The detonators he uses in his movers are exactly like the one I found at the Cultural Center attack.

I am so sorry for turning my back on you as my mentor. I need you now more than ever. <br><b>Tenzin:</b> I won't let you down. <i>(Korra smiles at him and they share a hug.

It lands on its front legs before her with a tremendous crash, scaring her off as it hisses at her.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Ah! <br><br><i>(Cut to Korra trying to find refuge near a tree with a green crab-like spirit crawling up the bark with human-looking fingers for legs.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Jinora! <br><br><i>(The camera pans in a circular motion through the forest, revealing many terrifying spirits gaping at Korra through the trees.)</i><br><br><b>Young Korra:</b> Jinora!             <br><br><i>(The camera finishes panning to reveal Korra as a young child, sobbing in fear.

It was yours long, long ago. <i>(picks up the teapot, displaying it to her)</i> When you were Avatar Wan, you used it to carry the Light Spirit Raava around until the two of you became one.

There is a box, and inside the box, there is a tiny man who sings and plays musical instruments. <br><b>Jinora:</b> Actually, when we speak, our voices produce sound waves.

Cut to an overhead shot as the fox trots over to another bookshelf further down the corridor and unshelves an old book and brings it over to Jinora, setting it down on the floor. Jinora sits down and opens the book as the fox sits next to her.)</i><br><br><b>Jinora:</b> Thanks, this is it. <i>(She gratefully pets the fox, before the fox trots off. She then flips through a page of writing to a page featuring a drawing of a great twisted tree among rocks, where Vaatu was imprisoned by Wan.)</i> The Tree of Time. That's where Avatar Wan imprisoned Vaatu. <i>(As Jinora reads, the camera zooms in on the black-and-white image of the tree and the picture becomes colored, revealing Vaatu's red form sitting inside the tree's hollow.)</i> "The elders believed that as long as the portals are closed during the Harmonic Convergence, Vaatu will remain imprisoned and the battle between good and evil will not be fought again." <i>(Mountains whoosh by in the foreground, until one reveals a drawing with an overhead angle of the part of the Spirit World where the two portals shoot blue and orange beams of light into the sky.

If you let it out, you can change the world around you. <i>(as Korra nods understandingly, Iroh indicates her dragon-bird)</i> Besides, look at this little fellow. This mountain is his home. When you first met him, you were frightened, <i>(Korra begins stroking the dragon-bird's neck, which it likes)</i> but does he seem scary to you now?           <br><b>Young Korra:</b> No.              <br><b>Uncle Iroh:</b> Many things that seem threatening in the dark become welcoming when we shine a light on them.          <br><br><i>(The camera zooms in on Iroh and Korra as they embrace each other in a hug.

Korra holds onto the dragon-bird tightly, and turns her head toward the mountain.

My name is Korra, and I'm taking this dragon-bird home.     <br><br><i>(Cut to a frontal shot of Korra as the camera pulls away from her, with the clouds parting and the sun shining overhead. As the sun shines down on them, the dog spirits morph into more friendly forms, with smaller teeth and their tongues panting from their mouths. One of them sits.

Cut to a wide shot of the perch as the dragon-bird lands on its feet before Korra. Cut to a closer shot from behind as the bird lowers its neck, and Korra approaches. She mounts the great beast's neck and holds onto its feathers as it rears its head back.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> All right, now let's close that portal and go find Jinora.       <br><br><i>(The dragon-bird gives a screech, then spreads its wings and flies away, leaving the dogs behind until they turn into wisps of blue light and fly after the bird.

The three wisps land behind the bird and turn back into giant dogs. With a determined look, Korra approaches the portal while her mount flies off.

He makes bending motions with his arms and Jinora floats into view, surrounded by the same spiraling ring shapes Unalaq had used on spirits in the South Pole. Only instead of bending rings of water, he is bending purple energy. Cut to a close-up of Jinora, looking quite terrified.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Jinora. <br><br><i>(Korra runs forward to save her friend. Before she reaches the base of the tree, the monstrous form of Furry-Foot crashes to the ground in front of Korra, growling at her. A frontal shot of Korra reveals the dogs she had tamed have now reverted back to their more monstrous forms as well, and are also growling at her. Korra angrily addresses Unalaq, pointing a finger at him.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> I can't believe I trusted you. You made me think you wanted to restore balance with the spirits but this, this isn't balance, it's madness. Now let her go.         <br><b>Unalaq:</b> If you want your friend to make it out of the Spirit World, you'll open the other portal <i>now</i>.      <br><b>Jinora:</b> Don't do it, Korra!      <br><br><i>(Unalaq turns to Jinora, directing even more focus on her with more urgent bending motions. An eerie purple glow begins to climb its way up her body, slowly enveloping her inch by inch until its reaches her face.

Cut to a panning close-up of Unalaq, grinning evilly.)</i><br><br><b>Unalaq:</b> What will it be? Open the portal, <i>(frowns darkly)</i> or lose your friend's <i>soul</i> forever?                    <br><br><i>(Cut to Jinora as the purple glow slowly takes over her whole body, her face almost completely covered by it as she seemingly gasps her final breaths.

With the monstrous dogs, Unalaq, and Furry-Foot in his dark form carrying Jinora and watching Korra closely from behind, she hesitates and then reaches toward the portal. Cut to a close-up of Korra's hand as it pauses within inches of the portal, before reluctantly coming into contact with the whirls of energy surrounding the portal. The shot begins to shake as the orb changes from purple to a bright yellow light. Cut to a low-angle shot of Korra with her head bowed, before the camera zooms in on her face as she lifts her head to reveal the glowing eyes of the Avatar. Cut to an overhead shot pulling back from the portal as jets of yellow light shoot out into the skies. Cut to Jinora's petrified expression. Cut to Unalaq shielding his eyes from the blinding light with his arms, before lowering them and grinning triumphantly. Cut to Korra's utterly blank expression as her eyes continue to glow and the portal opens. Cut to a wide shot of the realm as the chaotic bursts of light from the Northern portal calm into a single bright shaft of light like that of the Southern portal in the far background. Cut to the Tree of Time as a red glow crawls up its roots much in the way that Jinora had just experienced, rendering the entire tree in a radiant red color. A circular blast of energy erupts from the tree across the landscape. Cut to one of the dog spirits as it raises its head to the sky and roars. Cut to an angry-looking Korra, with her back to the Northern portal.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Now let Jinora go.<br><br><i>(Cut to a shot zooming away from Unalaq as he spins around, and sends a blast of water toward Korra. Cut to the camera following that water until it hits Korra in the arm. Where she was hit, the flesh turns briefly white and sparkling with energy, damaged in much the same way the dragon-bird was damaged earlier.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Ah!               <br><b>Unalaq:</b> <i>(bends more water toward her)</i> You should have come through the portal, then you could do this.     <br><br><i>(Korra tries dodging the blasts and whips of water, but they hit her again and again in the arms and deal more damage to her where the flesh becomes temporarily blue and sounds like something shattered. Cut to a shot from behind Korra as she leaps over Unalaq's attacks, getting closer to Jinora. Furry-Foot leaps off to the side, and then flies off with Jinora into the sky.)</i><br><br><b>Jinora:</b> Korra!             <br><br><i>(Cut to Korra's determined face, as she rushes to give chase to Jinora's captor, only for one of Unalaq's attacks to knock her back. She gets back up and runs, each blast of water missing her by inches. The camera follows her as Unalaq continues sending blasts of water at her until Furry-Foot has flown too far away and one of the dogs bashes into Korra from the side and sends her flying. Another dog leaps into the air and snatches Korra in its jaws while she was still falling. The dog lands perfectly on its feet, flexing its jaws and causing Korra to whimper from pain between all those teeth. Joined by the other two, the dog drops Korra to the ground, whereupon she is suspended into the air by some unseen force and purple rings begin to spiral around her. The camera pulls back to reveal Unalaq's boot in the foreground of the shot. Cut to Unalaq making bending motions, then to the camera panning up Korra's floating body as a purple glow begins to envelope her much more rapidly than with Jinora. Her face is almost completely covered by this dark mass. Cut to Unalaq continuing to go through his motions, before the camera zooms on his victorious grin. Cut to an overhead shot of the portals' realm, as the dragon-bird suddenly flies into view, screeching. Cut to a wide panning shot of the realm as the great spirit swoops toward Unalaq, stopping in mid-flight and whipping him aside with its tail. The dragon-bird then sidewinds over to Korra and plucks her in its talons before flying away with her, the dogs trailing behind on the ground. Cut to a very angry-looking Unalaq, surrounded by a cloud of dust. He turns in the direction of Vaatu when his voice resounds over the landscape.)</i><br><br><b>Vaatu:</b> I'll see you soon, Raava. <i>(cut to the Tree of Time, with the camera pulling back.)</i> Once the Harmonic Convergence comes, <i>(Cut to the camera following the dragon-bird as it flies further away with Korra.)</i> I'll be free from this prison. And then I will have my revenge.                     <br><br><i>(The camera closes in on Korra's unconscious face ominously. Suddenly, the dark background of the Spirit World morphs into the bright background of the material world. Korra's eyes open and she gasps aloud. Cut to a wide shot her in a sweat, panting with horror. Bumi, Kya, and Tenzin were lying asleep in the background, but slowly rise to their feet. Tenzin bolts to Korra's side, squatting next to her.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Korra. What was it like? Did you manage to close the portal? Was Jinora able to help you?          <br><br><i>(Cut to a close-up of Korra's face, looking utterly defeated and remorseful.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Tenzin, I'm- I'm sorry.              <br><br><i>(Tenzin's eyes are wide, and he turns to look at Jinora.

W-why isn't she waking up?<br><br><i>(Tenzin rushes to his daughter's body, and embraces it tightly, looking confused at why she is not waking up.

And in the Southern Water Tribe, Unalaq's army is nearing victory in the civil war but Tonraq isn't about to give up without a fight.   <br><br><br><br><b><u>Act I</u></b><br><br><i>(Fade into a wide establishing shot of the Eastern Air Temple. Oogi flies in front of the camera towards it, carrying Korra, Tenzin, Kya, Bumi, and Jinora. Cut to a shot of Pema picking flowers with Rohan on her back. Meelo stands in the background as he watches Ikki ride an air scooter and laugh happily. She dismounts the scooter as the camera pans up towards Oogi flying towards them.

Cut to a close up of Pema, shocked.)</i><br><br><b>Pema:</b> No!               <br><br><i>(Cut to a close up of Pema's feet as the flowers she's holding drop to the ground and she walks forward. Cut to a close up of Jinora as Pema takes her from Tenzin.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Her spirit is <i>trapped</i> in the Spirit World, but she's going to be all right.        <br><b>Pema:</b> How could this happen?    <br><b>Tenzin:</b> It was all my fault. I should have never let Jinora enter the Spirit World without me, I couldn't protect her.     <br><b>Korra:</b> I'm so sorry, Pema. I tried to save her, but Unalaq tricked me.     <br><b>Tenzin:</b> Don't worry, honey, I'm not going to stop until our little girl is back safe with us.      <br><br><i>(Tenzin gently strokes Jinora's cheek. Cut to an establishing shot of the Police Headquarters in Republic City at night. Cut to a shot of Mako sitting in a cell, hunched over. The shadow of a cop is seen on the floor from the barred window on the door as he unlocks and opens it.

What's with the fancy duds?   <br><b>Bolin:</b> I'm on my way to the big finale for "Nuktuk: Hero of the South." Yeah, everyone's gonna be there, except for, you know, you... because you're in jail and stuff.              <br><b>Mako:</b> Thanks for the reminder.      <br><b>Bolin:</b> Hey, I brought you something. I thought this would brighten up your new place. <i>(takes a rolled up Nuktuk poster out from his jacket and shows it, which Mako then takes)</i> Read the inscription.      <br><b>Mako:</b> "Dear Mako, Nuktuk says, 'Keep smiling'." <i>(looks up at a grinning Bolin)</i> Did you come by just to give me a poster?       <br><b>Bolin:</b> No. I came by to give you my sincere, heartfelt words of encouragement. I know our lives have been moving in two different directions, but I want you to know that I will always be there for you. We are brothers, after all, even if one of us is a member of high society and the other one is a criminal.         <br><b>Mako:</b> I am not a criminal!     <br><b>Bolin:</b> Of course <i>I</i> know that, but you do kinda look like one, 'cause you're in a jail, and that's where criminals live.<br><b>Mako:</b> I was set up! Varrick knew I had figured out he was hiring gangsters to pose as Northern soldiers to get Republic City to join the war. That's why he had me arrested. <br><b>Bolin:</b> Ah, I see what you're doing. You're going for the insanity defense. Smart.             <br><b>Mako:</b> No! I'm trying to tell you that Varrick isn't what he seems. Where's Asami? She'll listen to me.      <br><b>Bolin:</b> I asked her to come, but she said it was too hard for her. You being in jail like this reminds her of her dad. Okay, gotta run, but I'll be back tomorrow. And I am gonna get you the best attorney fame and fortune can buy. <i>(begins to exit the cell)</i>       <br><b>Mako:</b> Bolin, wait. If my theory about Varrick is right, something might go down tonight at your premiere. Promise me you'll keep your eyes peeled.     <br><b>Bolin:</b> Yeah, okay, big brother. I promise. <i>(knocks on the door and the cop lets him out)</i> Whew! That insanity defense is definitely gonna work.       <br><br><i>(The cop shuts the door as Bolin walks off. Cut to a wide, high angle establishing shot of the Southern Water Tribe. The camera zooms out until we see two pairs of legs standing on a mountain in the foreground side by side. Cut to a close shot of Tonraq and his rebels looking out over the area. One rebel turns to Tonraq.)</i><br><br><b>Rebel Leader:</b> Should we wait another day? Korra still might come with reinforcements.      <br><b>Tonraq:</b> We can't wait any longer. <i>(turns to address the rest of the rebels)</i> It's time we take back what is ours! It's time to take back our city!               <br><br><i>(The rebels all cheer. Cut to a wide shot from the side of Tonraq bending snow from the ground into an ice board and then riding it down the slope. The other rebels do the same and follow him. Cut to a shot from the side as they quickly slide down the mountain, the camera focusing on a close profile shot of Tonraq as he moves into frame. Cut to an extreme wide shot of the mountain and zoom out as we see the rebels moving down its side towards the city below, until the head of a Northern Tribe soldier enters frame. Cut to a shot of the soldier as he sees the rebels from his watch post. He gasps before ringing the bell next to him, sounding the alarm. Cut to a shot of more soldiers exiting their barracks and running towards the camera. The scene then cuts to a bird's eye view shot of the Pro-Bending Arena lit up at night, its spotlights waving as a crowd of people are gathered in front and cars drive up to it. Cut to a shot of a large Nuktuk poster hanging on the front of the building, then tilt down to a limousine driving up to the red carpet leading to the entrance, flanked by crowds of fans.

Cut to a shot of Bolin stepping out of the limousine and helping Ginger out by the hand. We cut to a shot of the crowd as they scream and clap with applause. Bolin and Ginger walk arm and arm past them, waving and smiling. The camera pans right with them and we see Shiro Shinobi holding a mircrophone.)</i><br><br><b>Shiro Shinobi:</b> There they are, folks, the sweethearts of the big screen, and Republic City's most <i>famous</i> couple, Bolin and Ginger.<br><b>Fan:</b> Let me get a picture.           <br><br><i>(Cut to a shot of Bolin and Ginger standing at the top of the staircase in front of the entrance, waving to the crowd before going inside the building. Cut to a shot of them inside as Bolin enters and Ginger starts to powder her face.)</i><br>     <br><b>Bolin:</b> Wow, that was fun. And did you hear what Shiro said? We're Republic City's most famous couple.       <br><b>Ginger:</b> Bolin, you're a doll, but you're as dumb as the rocks you bend. We are <i>not</i> a couple. <i>(walks away)</i>      <br><b>Bolin:</b> That's not what Shiro said.  <br><br><i>(Cut to an extreme closeup of Lu shoving a pastry into his mouth and biting into it, getting purple jelly filling on his face as he chews. Cut to a medium shot of Lu and Gang both eating pastries out on the red carpet as Chief Lin walks up to them with a stern expression.)</i><br><br><b>Lin:</b> Stop stuffing your moustaches with Varri-cakes and get to your post!      <br><b>Lu:</b> <i>(he and Gang drop their cakes and stand at attention)</i> You got it, boss. <i>(both walk off)</i>       <br><b>Lin:</b> You two are the pinnacle of refinement.         <br><br><i>(Another limo drives up to the carpet in the background. Cut to a closer shot as the door is opened and President Raiko exits the vehicle, followed by his wife Buttercup. They wave to the crowd.)</i><br><br><b>Shiro Shinobi:</b> This star-studded event just keeps getting star-studdier, folks. President Raiko and the first lady, Buttercup Raiko, just arrived. And they're being greeted by entrepreneur extraordinaire, Varrick.<br><br><i>(Cut to a shot from behind Varrick as he walks down the red carpet towards Raiko. Cut to a shot of the president and first lady as Varrick enthusistically shakes Raiko's hand.)</i><br>            <br><b>Varrick:</b> There they are, my two most honored guests. <i>(kisses Buttercup's hand)</i> What do you think? No expense has been spared. <i>(ushers Raiko and Buttercup towards the arena)</i> I brought in the finest entertainers from Ba Sing Se and the best food from around the world. Heck, I even had this red carpet imported from the Fire Nation. They make the best red stuff over there. Fact. All right, picture time!    <br><br><i>(The three stop a moment as cameras flash from off screen. Cut to a shot from behind the three as more people take pictures. Varrick reaches to put his hand on Raiko's shoulder.)</i><br><br><b>Raiko:</b> Varrick, you didn't have to do all this for us.   <br><b>Varrick:</b> I wanted to. Mr. President, I took one look at your wife, and I knew that you were a man of exquisite taste. <i>(Buttercup smiles and plces a hand on his face in slight embarassment)</i> And that's why I know you're gonna love this mover!  <br><b>Raiko:</b> Varrick, I know what you're doing, and I doubt your propaganda is going to change my mind about going to war with the Northern Water Tribe. <br><b>Varrick:</b> Oh, I think you'll be surprised how persuasive I can be.  <br><br><i>(There's one more camera flash before cutting to a wide shot of the inside of the pro-bending arena. A huge movie screen hangs over the center. Cut to a wide shot of President Raiko and Buttercup taking their seats in a balcony box, with two guards on either side of them. The camera pans right and tilts up to another balcony box with Asami, Bolin, and Ginger, with Naga and Pabu sitting in a balcony box next to them. A waiter brings a tray to Pabu and Naga and sets it down on a small table in front of them. He pulls the cover off, revealing an intricately decorated cake. Cut to a close up of Pabu and Naga eating into the cake, while in the background we see Varrick walk into the middle of the arena floor. The lights go off and Varrick is hit with a spotlight, and the camera zooms in and focuses on him.)</i><br><br><b>Varrick:</b> Thank you all for coming to the finale of "Nuktuk: Hero of the South". You know, when I first started this project, there were a lot of naysayers out there. "You can't make pictures move," they said. "You can't take some knucklehead earthbender and make him a <i>star</i>," they said. <i>(cut to a shot of Bolin's smile dropping)</i> "You can't teach a polar bear dog to speak," they said. Well, they're <i>wrong</i>. Thanks to the magic of the movers, our furry friends have found their voices, and you'll be shocked to hear what they have to say. They speak of the injustice that's happening in the Southern Water Tribe right now. <i>(cut to a wide shot of Raiko and Buttercup, with Varrick's head in the foreground, then to a close up of Varrick)</i> My hope is that their words and this epic mover will inspire a real-life hero to rise up and help. <i>(cut to a shot of President Raiko as he frowns, bemused and slightly embarssed from feeling put on the spot. Cut to a wide shot of Varrick)</i> Thank you again, enjoy the show! <br><br><i>(The camera tilts up to the screen as Varrick gestures to it. The spotlight goes off and the projector turns on. We see a shot of Nuktuk in the clutches of a giant bird's talons.)</i> <br><br><b>Deep Voice Narrator:</b> When last we left our hero, he was captured by the Evil Unalaq's dastardly pet bird. <i>(cut to a wider shot to show the bird flying, looking like a strange chicken)</i> Amazingly, with the power of his whistling, Nuktuk escaped...           <br><br><i>(Cut to the close shot of Nuktuk as he whistles. Cut to the wider shot of the bird as it drops Nuktuk, with an obvious jump cut in the editing. Cut to a shot of Nuktuk standing up in front of a worn underwater background with holes in it.)</i><br><br><b>Deep Voice Narrator:</b> And decided to seek out counsel.      <br><br><i>(Cut to a close shot of a large lion-seal clapping its fins and barking. Cut to a wider shot showing the seal on a pedestal as Nuktuk is kneeling in front of it. A fish is tossed to the seal from off camera, which it catches in its mouth.)</i><br><br><b>Nuktuk:</b> Thank you, wise sage. I will travel to Republic City and seek help.<br><br><i>(Cut to an overhead shot of a model of Republic City. The shadows of the miniature buildings can be seen on the background. The sound of a car horn is heard. Cut to a shot of an actor playing President as he holds a beaker and a glass flask while standing by a chemistry set. Nuktuk enters the room from a door in the background.)</i>         <br><br><b>Movie President:</b> Have a seat, I'm just working on a cure for the common cold. No longer will my citizens suffer from the sniffles.       <br><b>Nuktuk:</b> Mr. President, there's something more important than the sniffles right now. I need your help to stop the Evil Unalaq.    <br><br><i>(Cut to a high, wide shot of the movie screen.)</i><br><br><b>Movie President:</b> Did you say "help"? If there is one thing I love doing, it's helping people.<br><br><i>(The movie president looks at the camera on the last line. Cut to a shot of President Raiko and Buttercup as Buttercup leans in to whisper to him.)</i>      <br><br><b>Buttercup:</b> The seal-lion seemed a bit far-fetched, but the portrayal of this president is <i>right on the money</i>.     <br><br><i>(Raiko gives his wife a small smile. Cut to a shot of Bolin watching, then zoom out to include Asami in the shot as she turns to him.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> I think this is your best mover yet.     <br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(sadly)</i> I just wish Mako was here to see it.<br><br><i>(Cut to an extreme wide, high shot of the pro-bending arena outside. The camera pans right to a boat making its way across the water towards it. Cut to a low angle shot of the boat reaching the arena and going under the walkway around the edge. The boat contains waterbenders dressed as Northern Water Tribe soldiers. They begin to climb up from below and the camera tilts up to the windows of the building. Cut to a close up of Gang licking the frosting off the top of a Varri-cake.)</i> <br><br><b>Gang:</b> Mmm. I like to eat the top off the Varri-cake first.       <br><b>Lu:</b> I just try to shove the whole thing in my mouth at once. <i>(shoves the whole cake in his mouth, getting the filling on his lips again. He chews for a moment and gives a very dopey smile. Cut to a shot showing the water benders in the window frame behind the two detectives, who remain oblivious to the danger.)</i>     <br><b>Gang:</b> <i>(chuckles)</i> I love our job. Huh? <br><br><i>(The two turn around and notice the four waterbenders. Two of the benders bend water up from below and knock Gang and Lu down. Cut to a low angle shot of two waterbenders carrying an unconsious Lu to an open locker in the background, while Gang's Varri-cake falls to the floor in the foreground, splattering its jelly filling. We then see Gang carried into frame, unconsious with jelly on his face. Cut to commercial.)</i>  <br><br><br><br><b><u>Act II</u></b><br><br><i>(Fade in to an establishing shot of the pro-bending arena and the Nuktuk banner hanging over the entrance and slowly zoom in. Cut to a shot of the movie screen inside and slowly zoom in. On the screen is a shot of Nuktuk chained to a wall. The shot cuts to a wider shot showing him inside an ice cave as mechs roll up towards Nuktuk.)</i><br><br><b>Nuktuk:</b> Northern Water Tribe Automatons!

Cut to a wide shot as Nuktuk waves his arms at the automatons. A stage hand from behind the scenery to the right can be seen thowing a large basin of water at the Automatons, who begin to spark)</i> Looks like you forgot that water and Automatons don't mix.              <br><b>Automaton:</b> Beep bop boo. Oh, no, circuits not working.      <br><br><i>(The Automatons slump over as they power down.

Cut to a low angle shot of Bolin looking out sadly as Asami walks up next to him.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> Are you okay? It seems like this mover is really getting to you. You do know Juji's not really dead?        <br><b>Bolin:</b> Of course I know. Juji's fine. He comes back to life in the end when the doomsday device shifts the polarity of the Earth. Oops. Spoiler. Sorry.             <br><b>Asami:</b> Then what's wrong?      <br><b>Bolin:</b> I guess I just miss my friends. Everything is going so well for me, but it feels empty without everyone around. Korra's gone, Mako's in jail, you're doing... business lady stuff. Team Avatar's fallen apart.   <br><b>Asami:</b> I know, things have changed so much since we first met. Why don't you come back in and finish watching the mover with me?          <br><b>Bolin:</b> You go ahead. I need another minute.     <br><br><i>(Asami walks way from Bolin.

Suddenly, waterbender hands grab Raiko and Buttercup from behind, covering their mouths.)</i> <br><br><b>Nuktuk</b> I don't think so.       <br><br><i>(Raiko and Buttercup are pulled back as their voices are muffled. We cut to a shot of them being tied up by the waterbender, the two guards from before unconscious in the background.

The movie screen with Nuktuk on it can be seen in the background. Buttercup slips out of her gag and screams just as Gniger screams in the movie.

He does a breakdance kick and summons three earth disks from the floor before flinging them at the waterbenders with a spinning back kick. One of the waterbenders is hit with a disk while the other two duck under. One waterbender throws a stream of water at Bolin. Bolin rolls out of the way and throws two disks at him. The waterbender jumps over the disks and attacks with an arcing, overhead wave of water down at Bolin. Bolin cartwheels to the side to avoid it. He pops up another disk and flings it, but the waterbender ducks under it while the other one hits bolin with a stream.

He gets up and runs to the left to avoid an attack, and stops short before being hit by another. Bolin then runs forward, does a corkscrew hop, and slams his fists on the floor, making two tall stacks of earth disks pop out of the floor and land in front of him. The waterbenders each shoot of torrent of water at Bolin. Bolin brings his arms in front of him and the stacks of earth disks come together, forming a shield against the water. Cut to a shot from above as the water assaults Bolin, while on the movie screen we see Evil Unalaq also shooting a torrent of water at Nuktuk. Cut to a shot of Bolin holding his defense against the water. He pulls back and yells as he punches the stacks, shooting several disks out at the waterbenders.

Cut to Shiro Shinobi in the audience.)</i>    <br><br><b>Shiro Shinobi:</b> This is unbelievable! Bolin is bending two full stacks of earth discs at once, which would normally be illegal! But then again, he's fighting three waterbenders, so all rules are out the window!       <br><br><i>(Shiro puts his arm around the man sitting next to him, who tries to push Shiro's arm away but Shiro tightens his hold, oblivious to the man's discomfort due to excitement. Cut to a cloud of dust covering the view. A disks shoots through it and towards the camera. It collides with a waterbender, and Bolin flings two at another. The waterbender is knocked down by the disks, while the other one summons two streams of water, waving them around his body and throwing them at Bolin. Bolin corkscrew hops over the first, then pops up two disks to shield himself against the second. All the while, the mover shows Nuktuk fighting Evil Unalaq, matching most of Bolin's movements. Bolin throws another disk at the waterbender, who dodges, spinning around and throwing two more attacks at Bolin. Bolin jumps over them both, and on the second jump he summons an earth disk and shoots it. The disk collides with the waterbender, knocking him back into the speaker.

Two more soldiers move to attack him, but Tonraq freezes them in a large wave of ice.

Tonraq is thrown against it and yells out in pain, falling to his knees. He quickly gets back to his feets and throws a stream of water at Unalaq. Unalaq catches the stream with his bending and encircles it around himself before throwing it back at Tonraq and turning the water into ice. Tonraq dodges the ice, and punches another ice construct aimed at him. Tonraq rolls under a third frozen stream and rushes Unalaq. Unalaq frowns in frustration and begins to bend spikes of ice from the ground and the buildings at Tonraq. Tonraq rolls under them, dodges another, and smashes two more with a flying knee and a shoulder slam without stopping his run. Unalaq throws a water stream at Tonraq, but Tonraq rolls under it as he keeps getting closer. Tonraq bends an ice wall between him and Unalaq to shield him from Unalaq's next attack, which bursts through the ice, but Tonraq runs to the side and creates an ice slide with he rides upward.

As they become stuck to each other, wriggling frantically, the camera pans down to reveal Bumi cowering on the ground beneath them.)</i><br><br><b>Bumi:</b> It's not working!           <br><br><i>(Bumi scrambles and runs through the encampment past other soldiers as the dark spirits chase him. Cut to a close-up of Bumi's face as he runs faster, then stops suddenly. Cut to a shot of a dark spirit and then others flying in between two tents toward the camera. Cut to a frontal shot of two mecha-suits with Bumi in front of them, turning to run one way but then turning back as dark spirits chase him from both sides. Bumi scrambles up one of the suits and climbs inside, where we cut to him shutting himself in before the spirits can attack him. Cut to a shot of the mecha-suit as dark spirits latch onto it, then sink through the metal directly into it. Cut to Bumi buckled up inside, as the controls begin to spark and go haywire. The lamps inside turn on, and we cut to a close-up of the suit's caterpillar track treads spinning, kicking snow behind them and lurching forward. Cut to a shot from behind of the mecha as it runs right into a tent and doesn't stop, taking the canvas with it. The suit crashes into another tent, then zigzags into another, all while Northern soldiers flee. Cut to a close-up of Bumi's face, as he flails his hands about inside the smoke-filled machine and the glow from electric sparks light up his face.)</i><br><br><b>Bumi:</b> Get me out of here!       <br><br><i>(Cut to a close-up of a lever, as Bumi's hand pushes it forward. We then cut to a close-up of the mecha's arm spinning into frame, and a cable shoots out, flying toward a radio tower in the center of the encampment as we cut to a close-up of the clamp at the cable's end latching onto the tower. Cut to a shot of the blazing mecha, tethered by the cable to the off-screen tower, uncontrollably propelling itself in a circle over all tents and barracks in its way, hurtling toward the camera. We cut to a wide overhead shot of the camp as the suit continues running in a circle around the radio tower, crashing into tents and other standing structures. The mecha continues on its rampage over buildings in a side shot we cut to, with the tower static in the background. We cut to an overhead shot of a barrack as the cable swipes into it and flips it over, revealing a soldier rolling over in his cot to get some sleep and startling two soldiers playing Pai Sho at a small table where the barrack used to be standing. We cut to the wide overhead of the camp from earlier, with the mecha's circular path of destruction almost completed as it crashes into the last buildings standing. Cut to Bumi inside the mecha, as dark spirits come out of the walls toward him. He backs away in fear, and we cut to a close-up of his hand reaching behind him and yanking on a handle attached to a cord. We cut to a side shot of the mecha still going, as Bumi is ejected from the suit, still buckled in his seat. We cut to a frontal shot of Bumi screaming and hurtling toward the camera, then to a panning shot of Bumi's seat spinning wildly in the snow in one direction.)</i><br><br><b>Bumi:</b> Whoo-hoo!               <br><br><i>(Bumi continues continues spinning until he slides right into the entrance of the tent where Eska and Desna are watching over the captives. Bumi's spinning seat crashes into them both from behind, knocking them flat on their backs while he and the shot both come to a complete stop in front of the captives. Cut to a frontal shot of Bumi as the smoke and snow begin to settle behind.)</i><br><br><b>Bumi:</b> All right, guys. Rescue time!          <br><br><i>(Bumi gives a cheesy grin while the camera pans up and pulls back to reveal Eska and Desna standing up behind him, both looking very irritated. Still carrying Pabu on her head, Naga suddenly leaps through the entrance and swats Eska and Desna into each other with her paws, knocking them to the ground. Cut to a panning shot of the astonished expressions of Bumi, Asami, Kya, Tenzin, Tonraq, Korra, and Mako, some even blinking in disbelief. We cut to the wide overhead shot of the camp from before, but with everything within the mecha's circle of destruction destroyed or burning. The radio tower itself topples over.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Bumi, how did you manage to take out this entire encampment on your own?          <br><br><i>(Cut to a shot of the whole group standing outside the tent, Mako and Bolin holding an injured Tonraq up. Bumi reaches into his shirt and pulls out his flute to show Tenzin.)</i><br><br><b>Bumi:</b> I did it all with my trusty flute and- <i>(hangs his head low in despair)</i> Oh, never mind. You wouldn't believe it anyway. <i>(begins marching, leading the group away)</i> Let's get moving.           <br><br><i>(Cut to a wide shot of the fortress surrounding the forest containing the spirit portal. It has a breach in the walls. The group walks forward from off-camera in the direction of the portal, as the camera pans up the beam of light to the spirits circling it high in the sky. Cut to commercial.)</i><br><br><br><br><b><u>Act III</u></b><br><br><i>(Fade in to a wide shot of the group standing inside the forest, with Naga and Oogi sitting off to both sides as the camera pushes in. We cut to a shot of Tonraq limping forward, out from under Mako's supportive arm.)</i><br><br><b>Tonraq:</b> You run into the portal. I'll try to hold off anyone who comes after you.      <br><b>Korra:</b> No, you're too hurt. You need a healer. <i>(Cut to a side shot of Korra approaching Tonraq, turning her head to Asami standing in the background)</i> Asami, can you take Oogi and my Dad back to my Mom?      <br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(nods)</i> Mm-hmm.               <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(as Asami walks off-camera, Korra turns to face her father)</i> This is my fight now.     <br><b>Tonraq:</b> <i>(embraces his daughter)</i> Korra, I love you.           <br><b>Korra:</b> I love you too, Dad.     <br><br><i>(Cut to a shot zooming in on Asami on the back of Oogi, holding the reins, with Tonraq, Pabu, and Naga in the saddle behind her.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> Yip-yip.              <br><br><i>(Oogi rises from the ground and takes off. Cut to a shot pulling back, showing Korra and Tenzin watching Oogi flying away. We cut to a wide shot of the whole group, with Korra facing Tenzin.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Once we're inside, you go find Jinora. <i>(turns to Mako and Bolin)</i> Mako and Bolin will take care of Unalaq while I close the portal, so Vaatu can't escape.   <br><b>Bolin:</b> Wait a second. <i>(making animated gestures with his hands and panicked expressions)</i> Worst-case scenario: So we're fighting Unalaq, you close the portals, and let's just say <i>something</i> happens to you, are we gonna be trapped in there for <i>eternity</i>?     <br><br><i>(We cut to a wide shot from behind Kya, Bumi, Bolin, and Mako in the foreground, pushing in on Korra and Tenzin facing the group from the background.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> If everything goes as planned, we'll all walk out together after Harmonic Convergence. <i>(Cut to a close-up of Korra's face)</i> If not...                        <br><i>(Cut to a panning close-up shot of the sober expressions on Mako's, Bolin's, Bumi's, and then Kya's faces. We cut back to the same close-up of Korra, as she bows her head and sighs, then looks up at the group.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Let's go.               <br><br><i>(Cut to a wide shot of the portal down a long pathway through the trees, as Korra runs past the camera toward it. Bolin and Tenzin run after her, followed by Kya, Bumi, and Mako. Cut to a shot panning down the tree where Vaatu is imprisoned, as dark spirits circle around above it. Unalaq is facing thetree, standing upon the roots. We cut to a side shot of Unalaq, who turns his head toward the Southern Portal as the camera zooms in toward that. We cut to the portal as Korra, Mako, and Bolin walk through it, standing abreast. Tenzin, Kya, and Bumi are right behind them. Cut to a frontal shot of Unalaq standing atop a stone, as dark spirits roar and fly toward the camera. Unalaq leaps onto the back of one, riding it with his feet firmly planted on its back as we cut to an angled shot of the dark spirits flying toward the portal.)</i> <br><br><b>Korra:</b> Tenzin, go find Jinora!       <br><b>Tenzin:</b> Come on!              <br><br><i>(Tenzin, Kya, and Bumi run off, while Korra presses her fists together and she goes into the Avatar State, her eyes glowing. The camera pulls back very fast, as Korra runs forward and then makes a spinning kick in the air before bending a wave of air toward the camera. We cut to a wide overhead shot down the portal as this tsunami of air washes toward the dark spirits coming toward the portal. Cut to a side shot of the spirits flying forward from off-camera, then being hit and thrown backward by the blast of air. <br><br>The camera pans up as Unalaq leaps forward off the back of the spirit he was riding, spinning around high into the air. Cut to a shot of a creek of water bending upward and crystallizing into a tower of ice, the camera panning up its formation as Unalaq lands on its side and slides down to the ground while the camera pans down and pulls back. Still spinning as he slides forward, Unalaq bends more water past the camera as we cut to a side shot of Mako and Bolin running forward and leaping into the air. Mako bends a defensive line of fire and Bolin bends a block of earth upward from the ground, both defending against blasts of water. <br><br>Cut to a shot behind Korra as she runs toward the portal in the background. Cut to a frontal shot of Korra as she reaches both hands just past the camera, touching the portal. The camera zooms in closer on her face as her eyes glow and the shot shakes and fills with the portal's glowing aura. We cut to a shot behind Korra as the portal begins glowing more brightly with activity. Cut to an angled shot of Unalaq running forward, leaping into and spinning in the water as a boulder slides across the ground past him. Unalaq bends the block of ice from behind him into a whip of water, slashing at a fire blast coming right at him - extinguishing it in mid-air - and then bending a long blast of water past the camera. He then spins and sends another blast of water past the camera, and another. <br><br>Cut to an extreme wide shot panning past jagged peaks in the foreground while Unalaq battles Mako and Bolin in the background. Cut to Mako flipping backward in the air, dodging water as Bolin summons more boulders from the earth to block Unalaq's blasts. Korra is still trying to close the portal far behind them. When Mako lands, he sends more fire blasts past the camera, then nods to Bolin, who bends a promontory of rock out of the ground directly beneath Mako. This leads to a cut to a wide shot of the promontory's momentum propelling Mako into the air toward Unalaq. Bolin's bending slices the promontory in half and he sends the upper block at Unalaq, who blocks it with a defensive blast of water just as Mako sends another fire blast at him. Unalaq bends water to block that as well, then throws Mako backward out of the shot with one powerful blast of water. Bolin sends the lower block of his promontory sliding across the ground toward Unalaq, who brings a wave of water from off-screen to stop the block and then push it back toward Bolin. The block smashes into Bolin and breaks apart upon impact, sending Bolin flying backward. <br>Cut to a shot pointing up at Korra, still in the Avatar State, as she keeps trying to close the portal. The camera pans up the portal's beam, showing it to be thinning out when we cut to a shot zooming in on Vaatu's tree.)</i><br><br><b>Vaatu:</b> You're running out of time, Raava. I know you feel it coming.      <br><br><i>(Cut to a shot from behind Korra as the beam becomes thinner and thinner, then to a shot of the planets slowly coming into perfect alignment, with a colossal sun in the background. Cut back to a shot behind Korra, as the portal becomes as thin as a thread. Then the beam grows back and glows with an overwhelming brightness, blasting Korra backward, hurtling across the ground toward the camera. Cut to an extreme wide shot of the landscape, with the two portals intact and Vaatu's tree in between them. The camera pulls back as the portals become charged with electricity and then bend toward each other, connecting into a huge arc directly above the tree, brightly shining at the center. The lightning becomes more active between the portals, as we cut to a shot of Korra on her knees, looking up at the electric arc of light overhead. <br><br>Cut to a close-up of Unalaq's grinning face as the wind picks up. Cut back to the wide shot of the landscape as the bright light at the center of the arc shrinks and then splits, shooting down both branches of the arc into the two portals. Cut to a wide shot of Eska and Desna standing outside the fortification surrounding the forest, as the spirit portal glows yellow and a circular blast of purple energy flies outward from the portal, knocking the twins backward through the snow. Cut to Desna and Eska both looking onward in fear. <br><br>Cut to an aerial overhead shot of the earth as the purple light blankets the landscape. Then we cut to a shot of the planet, as the purple light can be seen creeping over the atmosphere from both the North and South poles. Cut to a wide shot of Republic City from the harbor, as the purple atmosphere swoops past. Cut to a shot of a street in Republic City as the energy sweeps through, blanketing the whole area. Cut to a close-up of Lin as she holds her hands in front of her, protecting her eyes from the wind as the dark energy sweeps over her, rendering her and her surroundings in a dark purple hue. Lin looks up toward the sky, and we cut to an angled shot pointing up from between the streets at the sky, showing green lights dancing in the purple atmosphere. <br><br>We cut back to the shot of the planet, as the two purple waves coming from the poles meet at the equator, covering the whole world. Cut back to a wide shot of the two portals in the Spirit World, as several sparks of lightning begin coming from the arc of light and striking Vaatu's tree below. We cut to a frontal shot of the tree being struck by lightning as it begins to glow red. The glow becomes brighter and brighter until the lightning suddenly stops, and all light fades to a single point of red light coming from Vaatu's prison until all is completely dark. <br><br>Then the camera zooms backward as a great blast of white light erupts from the tree across the landscape. The light fades to reveal Vaatu flying out of his prison toward the camera and stopping in mid-air between the two portals. Cut to a panning shot of Mako and Bolin looking to the sky, with Korra still sitting on the ground far behind them, as the wind throws bits of dirt past them. <br><br>Cut to Vaatu flying up, then swooping down below the shot, only to fly back up right in front of the camera and cackle maniacally. The camera pulls back very fast from Vaatu, bringing Korra into the lower foreground of the shot. We then cut to a shot pushing in on Korra, looking dishevelled and staring with terrified eyes up at Vaatu, who is now freed.)</i><br><br><br><br>[End Credits]<br>

It's your Uncle Bumi.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> Ah, this isn't working.

The three humans run away screaming, and the spirit spits webbing from its mouth at them. Cut to a shot of Tenzin and zoom out as he stops just at the edge of a cliff, trying to keep his balance. Kya and Bumi bump into him as the spirit closes in on them, and they are forced to jump off. Cut to a shot of Tenzin, Kya, and Bumi falling at the camera, the dark spirit looking at them from above.

Now where are we?<br><b>Tenzin:</b> We're completely lost.<br><br><i>(Cut to a shot of Korra's legs as she lands on a rock and pops up a rock below before kicking it. She leaps back and bends the water from a stream before also flinging it at Vaatu. Vaatu dodges the attacks, as well as a blast of fire and a gust of wind. Korra goes into the Avatar State and uses a gust of air to launch herself at Vaatu. Cut to an extreme wide shot as Korra attacks Vaatu in the air over the tree and under the arc of the connected spirit portals, Vaatu twisting around to avoid the attacks. Korra hits Vaatu with water and flips backward. Fire shoots from the bottom of her feets before she hits the ground, causing her to hover. Vaatu whips a tendril at Korra, but Korra uses fire to shield herself from it, then immediately retialiates by spinning around and shooting a huge, spiraling blast of fire at Vaatu with both fists. The spiraling blast drills through Vaatu's center, and Korra flies through him on a whirlwind. Korra once again hovers on jets of fire before landing as Vaatu reforms himself and attacks her with a tendril whip. Korra dodges back and the ground where she was standing is smashed, but Korra is then hit when Vaatu shoots an energy beam at her. She yells in pain as she's knocked back and collides with a rock, then groans when she lands on her hands and knees. Vaatu straightens back up and heals his wounds before shooting two tendrils into the ground. Many vines grow from the ground around Korra and ensnare her, lifting her off the ground.)</i>   <br><br><b>Korra:</b> No!<br><br><i>(Korra struggles.

The two brothers look at each other a moment before staring back into the surrounding forest. Cut to a panning left shot through the trees behind Mako, Bolin and the portal, the trees quickly passing in front of the camera. A large chunk of ice suddenly erupts from the ground, and several ice shards are flung at Mako and Bolin. Mako turns and looks in surprise.)</i>  <br><br><b>Mako:</b> Huh?<br><br><i>(Bolin creates a wall of stone to block the ice. Mako ducks behind it, then starts shoots two fire blasts from the cover into the forest where the attack came from. Bolin lifts up two large chunks of stone and throws them into the trees, knocking one down as the stones crumble into dust. The brothers stand and wait for the dust to clear, until they hear an attack come from behind them. Mako and Bolin gasp and roll out of the way as more ice shards fly at them. Mako stands and uses a punch and kick to shoot two fire blasts. Bolin does a backflip to lift a stone pillar from the ground and launches it forward with a punch. He then turns to the side and creates a stone barrier to protect himself from a chunk of ice, but it breaks through the stone and knocks Bolin back. Bolin slides over the snow next to Mako and stands back up.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> I don't know if we can win this fight.<br><b>Mako:</b> We don't need to win.

She enters the Avatar State, and the camera zooms out as she breathes a huge torrent of fire at Vaatu. Vaatu is pushed back and releases his hold. Korra looks down and breathes fire at the vines, burning them and freeing herself. Korra does a butterfly kick to throw out an arc of wind, then bends a stream of water at Vaatu. Vaatu is hit by the water stream, then another, and avoids a fire blast. Korra stomps the ground to pop up two large rocks, then bends them into large spikes that shoot into Vaatu and knock him into the air before Korra splashes him with more water. Cut to a close up of Korra as she lifts herself into the air on a whirlwind. She encases the stunned Vaatu in a wind bubble, and surrounds it with rings of water, fire, and earth before setting back down on the ground.)</i> <br><br><b>Korra:</b> I'm locking you away for another 10,000 years, Vaatu!<br><br><i>(Korra circles her arms before she begins to push the trapped Vaatu back towards the hole in the giant tree.

Mako and Bolin stand up back to back to face the twins when they are blasted to the side by a large torrent of water. Cut to a shot of the brothers knocked out on the ground. The camera tilts up to reveal Unalaq riding in on a wave of water as Eska and Desna walk towards him. Cut to an overhead shot as the water disperses on the ground.

Cut to a wide overhead shot as Korra and Unalaq fly away from the portal, Korra riding a whirlwind and Unalaq riding a waterspout. Korra bends fire at Unalaq and he blocks it with waterbending and a wall of ice. As they fly over the ground, Korra throws a gust of wind at Unalaq. He dodges and throws shards of ice back at her. Korra blocks them by earthbending up dozens of large boulders from below the ground, then throws them at Unalaq. Unalaq creates two large water whips and cuts through the boulders before throwing a torrent of water at Korra. Korra bends water in front of her and creates an ice shield, but Unalaq wraps the water around it, freezing it around Korra before throwing her to the ground. Korra rolls and skids and slides over the snow, grunting in pain before collapsing on her back.

Cut to a shot from behind them, then tilt up to Korra and Unalaq still battling, flying around on their whirlwind and waterspout in the distance past the dead trees. Mako and Bolin run towards them. Unalaq bends water at Korra, and Korra bends fire back at him. Cut to Korra as she corkscrews in the air and surrounds herself in fire as she drills through a torrent of water Unalaq throws at her. The fire and water dissipate, and as Korra turns in the air, she uses earthbending to kick three large boulders at Unalaq. They hit him and explode into a cloud of dust. Unalaq rises out of the dust and bends water back at Korra as she lands on the side of a hill. Korra leaps away and avoids the water as it hits the ground below. She continues backflipping as Unalaq throws more attacks at her. Korra then bends a pillar of stone underneath her to launch herself into the air. She does two spinning kicks and a swipe of her fist and bends fireballs at Unalaq. He dodges them, then swings a large stream of water down at Korra. Korra blocks it with her hand and is pushes back. Korra holds onto the water and swings her arm around. The water around Unalaq's arm at the other end of the stream freezes and Korra yanks him down to the ground. A dust cloud is made from the impact. As it blows away, Unalaq gets back on his feet, still tethered to the water stream connected to Korra. Korra uses her other hands to send another stream of water at Unalaq's other arm and also freezes it. Unalaq's eyes glow just before he swings his arms up, breaking the ice, then whips them back down, pulling Korra in close in a waterbending tug of war. Cut to a shot of Korra struggling as she slides over the ground. Cut to an extreme wide shot as they are pulled closer.

Cut to an over the shoulder shot of Unalaq as his eyes glow and he smirks. His head jerks from side to side as he tilts it up and opens his mouth, a purple glow coming from inside it. The camera tilts up as glowing purple energy and black tendrils rise from inside Unalaq's mouth. Cut to Bolin and Mako running as they watch what is happening. Cut to a shot from the side as we see Korra and Unalaq tethered by the water, and the tendrils growing longer and curling down. Cut to a shot of Korra as she looks up. She frowns and starts to breath a blast of fire, but suddenly the tendrils latch onto her face and snuff out the flame. Cut to a shot of Korra and Unalaq as the water tether dissipates and Korra falls to her knees, the tendrils and purple energy going into her mouth. Cut to a close up of Korra from the side as the tendrils pull back. We hear Korra yell, and see gold spiritual energy being pulled out through her mouth and eyes. Cut to a wide shot as the tendrils pull Raava out of Korra's body, and Korra falls to the ground. Cut to a shot of Korra as the energy finally leaves her, her expression lifeless. Korra's eyes look up, and we cut to her point of view as her eyes focus on Unalaq standing above her, water tentacles surrounding his arms. Her gaze tilts up to Raava being held by the tendrils coming from Unalaq's mouth. The water tentacles whip around before Unalaq uses them to create a bubble of water around Raava. Cut to a close up of Unalaq as the black tendrils, Vaatu's tendrils, descend back inside Unalaq's mouth. Unalaq tilts his head down, his eyes radiating orange light, and grins.

Raava is freed from the water and drops to the ground as Unalaq raises another ice shield, which is shattered by the stone and the second fire blast. Unalaq smirks as the debris around him blows away. As Mako and Bolin run towards him, Unalaq bends a huge erupting wave of snow, ice, and rocks at them, knocking the brothers away.)</i> <br><br><b>Mako & Bolin:</b> <i>(simultaneously)</i> Aah!<br><br><i>(Cut to an extreme wide shot as the wave turns into ice.

She and Raiko land and slide over a roof, destroying the tiles and stopping just at the edge as the airship falls behind them. Lin stands and Raiko is laying on his side as the camera cuts to an over the shoulder shot of them looking over the city and at UnaVaatu in the bay.

There may still be a way for you to stop Vaatu.<br><b>Korra:</b> How?<br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(kneels down)</i> Let go of your attachment to who you <i>think</i> you are, and connect with your inner spirit.<br><b>Korra:</b> Haven't you heard anything I said?

Cut to a high overhead shot looking through the branches of the giant tree down at Korra and Tenzin walking towards it.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Why are you showing me Vaatu's prison?<br><b>Tenzin:</b> Because this tree had a history <i>long</i> before it held Vaatu. This is the Tree of Time, and the legends say that its roots bind the Spirit and Physical Worlds together.<br><b>Korra:</b> And you think this tree can help me somehow?<br><b>Tenzin:</b> Yes. I have read that long ago, the ancients would meditate beneath this tree, and connect with the great cosmic energy of the universe.<br><br><i>(Tenzin steps forward and jumps up the the edge of the hollow part of the tree, then joined by Korra. The look inside, and images appear at the back of the tree as Korra walks inside. They show past events from Korra's life, using clips from previous episodes.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> These are my memories.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> The Tree of Time remembers all. Korra, the most powerful thing about you is not the spirit of Raava, but your own inner spirit. You have always been strong, unyielding, and fearless.<br><br><i>(The images merge and show Wan when he was young.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Avatar Wan.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> Before he fused with Raava, Wan was just a regular person.<br><b>Korra:</b> But he was brave and smart and always wanted to defend the helpless.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> That's right. <i>(the image shows Wan feeding his animal friends, then him doing firebending to protect the spirits, and then the spirits rejoicing around him)</i> He became a legend because of <i>who</i> he was, not <i>what</i> he was. He wasn't defined by Raava any more than you are.<br><br><i>(An image forms behind them and they look to see UnaVaatu throwing Aang's statue down, making Korra gasp.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Everyone in Republic City is in danger!<br><b>Tenzin:</b> You have to help them, Korra.<br><b>Korra:</b> How?

He turns for one last look at Korra as she sits down in the center of the tree and begins to meditate. There is a blue glow above her, and we cut to a shot looking at Korra's back as Tenzin exits the tree in the background. Cut to a low angle close up of Korra and tilt up to an image above her, showing Wan and Raava as Wan airbends.)</i><br><br><b>Wan:</b> If you and Vaatu have the same fight every 10,000 years, why hasn't one of you destroyed the other?<br><b>Raava:</b> He cannot destroy light any more than I can destroy darkness. One cannot exist without the other.<br><br><i>(Dissolve to a close up of Korra and slowly zoom in.)</i><br><br><b>Unalaq:</b> <i>(from Korra's memories)</i> Find the light in the dark.<br><br><i>(The scene fades to white as the zoom quickens, and changes to the world within Korra's soul, the sky filled with stars. Tilt down to Korra standing on a path of light as she opens her eyes. She looks around and sees a giant form of her own spirit holding a ball of energy, just as Aang did in the past. Korra stares at it in awe for a moment before she puts on an expression of resolve and begins to walk towards it. Cut to an extreme wide shot of Korra walking on the path of light, looking like an aurora. Cut to a close shot of Korra's spirit, and tilt down to the ball of light as Korra enters it. It glows brighter, filling the screen with white light, and we cut back to Korra in the Tree of Time. She begins to glow bright blue, and her spirit exits from her body, starting to grow.

Cut to an extreme wide side shot as we see UnaVaatu prop himself up with tendrils from his back and face Korra. Cut to a low angle shot of UnaVaatu as his chest pattern glows bright. Korra waves her arms around and begins to power up. UnaVaatu fires his chest beam at Korra, and Korra fires a chest beam of her own back at him. The beams colide and create a shockwave, sending waves through the water. The beams push against each other, and Korra puts more power into hers. Korra beam pushes back against UnaVaatu's until he is overpowered, and the blue beam blasts him backward over the water. Korra begins to run toward UnaVaatu, and he looks up and throws his tendrils at her. Korra grabs two of the tendrils and pulls on them, pulling UnaVaatu off balance before Korra delivers a flying knee to his chin, then follows it up by reeling him in with all his tendrils, picking him up over her shoulders, and then tossing UnaVaatu into a cliffside. UnaVaatu has a brief moment to look up and sees Korra jumping at him, just before she delivers an powerful punch to his stomach that is strong enough to create a shockwave.<br><br>Korra places her hand over UnaVaatu's face and presses his head againt the cliff, while with her other hand points her fingers at the center of his chest, then gives it a palm strike which sends waves of gold light through his body. Cut to Korra looking confused and worried as UnaVaatu's tendrils rise behind her and wrap around her torso and wrists, pulling her away and snaring her as she struggles to become free.)</i> <br><br><b>UnaVaatu:</b> You are looking for something that is gone. Raava has been destroyed, and soon you will be too!<br><br><i>(Cut to an extreme wide shot as UnaVaatu fires a massive energy beam from his chest at Korra at point blank range. It begins as a purple sphere that grows until it erupts into a huge blast that pushes past Korra. Cut to a close up of Korra being hit by the beam, held by UnaVaatu's tendrils. The energy dissipates, and Korra hangs her head in fatigue. Cut to a wide shot as UnaVaatu drops Korra to her knees.

Cut to Korra and UnaVaatu as Korra stumbles backward in the water. UnaVaatu waves his arms, powers up, and releases another energy beam from his chest. Korra is violently blasted back by it and falls into the water, laying there unconscious. UnaVaatu waves his arms again and begins to waterbend a double helix of water around Korra. She is lifted up by it, and she and the water begin turning purple, starting from her feet and spreading upward towards her head. The scene cuts as just as it reaches Korra neck, and we return to the group in the Spirit World fighting the dark spirits. Tenzin leaps backwards towards the base of the tree where everyone is fending off the spirits, who pressure them with a relentless assault. Cut to Bolin throwing large rocks and grunting. After he does a kick, we cut to a close up of Bolin's foot as a dark spirit's tendril wraps around his ankle and starts dragging him in.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Heeeeeelp!<br><br><i>(The spirit is hit by a stream of water and disappears, letting go of Bolin.

Cut to a wide shot as the light continues to grow and illuminates the whole city until the screen goes white. Cut to the water around Korra falling as she falls back to her feet, cleansed.

It grows larger, as a group of smaller light particles, and Korra pulls the light out of UnaVaatu. Cut to a wide shot as Korra pulls Raava out and UnaVaatu falls to his hands and knees. Korra then begins to wave her arms and bends a double helix around UnaVaatu. He stands up and looks towards the sky as the water begins to glow with golden light.

Cut to a shot of Mako grabbing Bolin's hand as he pulls his brother inside the Tree of Time. The swarm of dark spirits are pushing the group back as Tenzin covers Mako and Bolin. Mako shoots blasts of fire as well, but is knocked back by a dark spirit's tail. Tenzin jumps back inside the tree and continues to blast the spirits back with wind. The spirits are too numerous though, and they begin entering the tree, all of them blocking the only way out. Cut to an extreme wide shot of the area as a bright ball of light forms at the top of the portals' energy arc.

I couldn't save him.<br><b>Eska:</b> It seems Cousin Korra is under the impression we are saddened by our father's demise.<br><b>Desna:</b> But I will not miss him at all.

She rises her hand towards the portal, and we cut to a close up of her hand as she hesitates.)</i> <br><br><b>Korra:</b> Maybe I shouldn't.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> What do you mean?<br><b>Korra:</b> What if Unalaq was right when he said the Avatar <i>shouldn't</i> be a bridge between the two worlds? <i>(Bumi plays fetch with Bum-Ju)</i> What if Avatar Wan made a <i>mistake</i> when he closed the portals? What if humans and spirits <i>weren't</i> meant to live apart? Well, what do you think I should do?<br><b>Tenzin:</b> I think you should trust your instincts.

I'm sorry for blowing up at you.<br><b>Mako:</b> That's okay. <i>(holds Korra's hand)</i> I think we both said some things that we regret.<br><b>Korra:</b> Why didn't you just tell me the truth in the first place?<br><b>Mako:</b> I know I should have but... I didn't wanna hurt you all over again. I guess part of me wanted to forget about the breakup too.<br><b>Korra:</b> I think we both know that this...

And the Southern Council of Elders has appointed my father, Tonraq, to be your new Chief! <i>(the crowd cheers as Tonraq steps forward and waves)</i> I've realized that even though we should learn from those who came before us, we must also forge our own path. So that is why I've decided to keep the portals open. <i>(we see Bum-Ju on Bumi's shoulder and he chirps)</i> Humans can now physically enter the Spirit World and spirits will be <i>free</i> to roam our world. I will no longer be the bridge. Humans and spirits must <i>learn</i> to live together. My mission will always be to use Raava's light spirit to guide the world toward peace and balance. Harmonic Convergence has caused a shift in the planet's energy, I can feel it. Things will never be the same again. We are entering a new age.<br><br><i>(Cut to a wide shot of the palace.

Running footsteps are heard and Bumi is seen chasing after the bunny spirit.)</i>       <br><br><b>Bumi:</b> Come back, Bum-Ju!   <br><br><i>(Switch to a side view shot of a tree and Bum-Ju hovers on top of a branch extending outwards. Bumi climbs up the tree trunk and onto the branch. Bum-Ju thrills and camera cuts to a desperate looking Bumi.)</i> <br> <br><b>Bumi:</b> If you don't <i>(pulls out a small pink sweater)</i> wanna wear the sweater I made you, that's fine. I'm <i>sorry</i> I got mad.  <br><br><i>(Return back to the previous shot as Bumi eases himself forward, reaching out to Bum-Ju but the spirit flies out of his reach. The branch begins to bend downwards from Bumi's weight.)</i>    <br><br><b>Bumi:</b> Bum-Ju, I'm running out of tree. <i>(looks to Bum-Ju)</i> Can we go down now? <i>(the tree branch splits, leaving a little sliver of wood stuck to the tree trunk. Bumi slides down the branch and grasps the end of it. Cut to an overhead shot of Bumi and we can see a strip of sand below, quite a distance away from his position.)</i> Bum-Ju, a little help?   <br><br><i>(The branch starts to fully break, lowering Bumi as it does. Bum-Ju thrills and bites the back of Bumi's military coat but his arms slip out of the coat, causing him to fall.)</i><br><br><b>Bumi:</b> Ah! Ahh!    <br><br><i>(Cut to a frontal shot of Bumi as he thrusts his palms out and he bends a gust of air. He opens his eyes and is surprised. Switch to a profile shot of Bumi hovering a little above the sand with his airbending and Bum-Ju slowly descends to Bumi with his coat.)</i>      <br>    <br><b>Bumi:</b> <i>(to Bum-Ju)</i> Look! I'm airbending. <i>(the airbending stops and he falls to the ground flat on his face)</i> Ow! Wow, that still hurt a lot.   <br><br><i>(Scene changes to a water droplet falling onto a leaf in the forest. Camera pans right to show Korra with a glider staff in hand walking under a bunch of roots followed by Tenzin. Jinora runs after them and a group of spirits appear behind the girl. Cut to an overhead shot of the forest to reveal trees growing out of some buildings.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> How are we ever gonna clear away all these vines?  <br><br><i>(Cut back to the ground and Korra twirls her staff behind her before thrusting her palm out, bending out a big cloud of fire towards some vines. The spirits behind Jinora suddenly disappear. The vines retreat and we cut to the inside of a doorway that was previously covered in vines. However, the tendrils of the plants creep back to the doorway more forcefully than ever. Cut to an exasperated Korra and Jinora can be seen comforting her spirit friends in the background.)</i> <br>       <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(frustrated)</i> Ugh! <i>(Jinora and Tenzin turn towards her)</i> I don't get it! I can vanquish Vaatu, <i>(walks away off-screen)</i> but not a bunch of stupid vines?<br><b>Tenzin:</b> I'm sure you'll find a way.          <br><b>Jinora:</b> Why do you wanna get rid of them? You changed the World. We're connected with the spirits again. The wilds are their home. <br><br><i>(Cut to Korra approaching a bunch of vines hanging down and we can see light from behind them.)</i><br>      <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(smiles wryly at Jinora)</i> I don't think the people who used to live here are as excited about it as you are.           <br><br><i>(Korra uses her glider stick to push aside a curtain of vines, revealing bright sunlight. Shot changes the outside to reveal that the Spirit Wilds have sprung up in the middle of a neighbourhood in Republic City.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> I gotta <i>(Korra releases the wings on her glider)</i> go face the press and tell them I still don't have a way to get rid of the vines. <i>(Korra starts to run off to gain momentum)</i> This should be fun.       <br><br><i>(View changes to the back of Tenzin's and Jinora's heads as they watch Korra take off to the air with her glider.<br><br>Location changes to City Hall that is covered in vines as well. There seems to be a press conferencing going on.)</i><br><br><b>Male Reporter #1:</b> Mr. President, are you concerned that your <i>(switch to a close up to the podium where Raiko is standing. Lin along with her police force stand guard beside and behind him)</i> approval ratings are now nearly as low as the Avatar's? <i>(cut to a close up of the reporter with a feathered hat and he speaks with his hand raised in the air)</i> Have you seen today's headline? It says, "Raik-Oh-No. Polls pan, Prez plans!"    <br><br><i>(View switches to the president.)</i> <br><br><b>Raiko:</b> I'm not concerned with snappy put-downs in the press. I'm facing this calamity just like <i>every</i> other citizen. <i>(cut to a profile shot of the president as he points to a vine coming out of City Hall)</i> There's a tree growing right through my <i>office</i>. You think I'm not doing everything I can to get rid of it?  <br><br><i>(Korra flies in on her glider from the side and the president turns his attention towards her. Korra creates a cloud of air to cushion her landing, messing up Raiko's hair and his glasses. Raiko looks peeved by her entrance. There's murmuring amongst the reporters from Korra's appearance.)</i>  <br><br><b>Reporter in Crowd:</b> A few questions, please!       <br><b>Male Reporter #2:</b> Avatar Korra! <i>(the President pushes his glasses back into place)</i> Do you regret the way <i>(Raiko pushes a hand up to smooth his hair back)</i> you handled the Unalaq crisis? <br><br><i>(View returns to the reporters as a camera flash goes off. A female reporter in a navy blue hat raises her hand.)</i><br><br><b>Female Reporter #1:</b> Why are you forcing the integration of spirits in Republic City?           <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(places a hand on her chest)</i> Listen, I've been trying everything I can think of  to get rid of these vines, but-              <br><b>Male Reporter #3:</b> <i>(interrupts)</i> Why can't you fix this?      <br><br><i>(Cut to a reporter with a camera in hand.)</i> <br><br><b>Male Reporter #4:</b> Are the vines here to stay?  <br><br><i>(Cut to another female reporter.)</i><br><br><b>Female Reporter #2:</b> Is this part of  your New World Order?    <br><br><i>(Switch to a close up of Korra.)</i>  <br><br><b>Korra:</b> Look! Harmonic Convergence was just a couple weeks ago. I just need a little more time to get everything back to normal.         <br><b>Raiko:</b> <i>(speaks suddenly)</i> The Avatar <i>(camera pans left to the podium)</i> has put us all in a very difficult position, <i>(Korra looks confused)</i> but my administration-     <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(irritably interrupts)</i> Oh! I'm sorry. <i>(Raiko turns to her)</i> Did I put you <i>(walks to the President)</i> in a difficult position by fighting <i>(cut to a close up profile shot of Raiko as Korra gets in his face)</i> the giant force of Pure Evil that was going to destroy the whole World? <i>(grabs Raiko by the chin)</i> Maybe your administration <i>(moves his chin up and down slightly)</i> could've handled that! <i>(Raiko and Korra glare angrily at each other)</i>    <br><b>Lin:</b> <i>(separates Korra and Raiko apart)</i> That's all! No more questions! <br><br><i>(The President storms back into City Hall and Lin gives Korra a look. Switch to a profile shot of Korra as the reporters stream past her. Asami walks up to her friend.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> This is a disaster.      <br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(reassuringly)</i>  Don't worry, we'll figure something out.   <br><b>Korra:</b> Easy for you to say. <i>(Asami is a little appalled)</i> You don't have my poll numbers. Eight percent approval? Who were they asking?      <br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(comforts Korra)</i> You can't take that to heart. People are just frustrated.   <br><b>Korra:</b> I don't blame them. I should be able to fix this. I'm the Avatar.         <br><br><i>(Cut to Ikki and Meelo playing with Pabu in the courtyard on Air Temple Island. Bumi runs into screen to his nephew and niece. He stops, panting to catch his breath.)</i><br><br><b>Bumi:</b> You are not gonna believe what just happened. Where's your father?      <br><b>Ikki:</b> <i>(hollers)</i> Daaad! <br><br><i>(Cut to a set of doors opening to reveal Tenzin.)</i>            <br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(looks around worriedly)</i> What is it? What's wrong?     <br><br><i>(He runs forward and camera angle changes to the walkway leading out to the courtyard. Tenzin is followed by Jinora, Pema with Rohan carried on her back, and Kya.)</i>     <br><br><b>Bumi:</b> <i>(excitedly runs to his brother)</i> The most amazing, wondrous, fantastical thing just occurred. Okay, Bum-Ju and I had <i>(punches his fist together)</i> a little fight. I made him <i>(does a knitting action with his hands)</i> this sweater, and he didn't seem to like it. And I'll admit it might need work, but it was my first attempt at knitting. So I was <i>(rests his hands on his chest)</i> a little hurt.   <br><br><i>(Cut to a close up of Tenzin who isn't amused.)</i>  <br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(deadpans)</i> Hilarious. <i>(turns around and walks away)</i> Time for dinner, everyone.      <br><br><i>(Switch back to Bumi with his niece and nephew standing by his side.)</i><br><br><b>Bumi:</b> No! Check this out. <i>(brings his arms up to his waist)</i> I can airbend! <i>(thrusts his palms out but nothing happens and he repeats it a few times)</i> Yeah, wait. <i>(Ikki and Meelo look disappointed)</i> Seriously. I was doing it. <i>(Bumi does punching movements again but Ikki and Meelo just walk off)</i> Oh, hold on. I just... Maybe if I... <i>(kicks his leg up)</i> No.           <br><br><i>(Cut to food on the dinner table.)</i><br><br><b>Bumi:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> I swear I'm not making it up! <br><br><i>(Camera pans across the dinner table as Bumi makes several offensive motions with his arms. Bolin can be seen nonchalantly eating his food beside the ex-commander.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(frowns)</i> Stop waving your arms around at the table. It's not funny anymore.  <br><br><i>(Camera zooms out to a full view of the dining room as Korra and Asami walk in.)</i>   <br><br><b>Bumi:</b> <i>(crosses his arms)</i> It's <i>not</i> a joke.          <br><br><b>Korra:</b> What's up with him? <i>(sits down beside Bolin)</i>     <br><b>Bolin:</b> Bumi says he airbended earlier, but he can't now. <i>(Korra looks surprised)</i> Oh, and I guess he's not very good at knitting either. I gotta say, I love being a part of this family. <i>(cut to a shot of Tenzin with a vein pulsing on his head)</i> You got the grumpy dad, <i>(cut to Bumi trying to airbend)</i> the wacky uncle. <i>(cut to slightly stressed Pema with Rohan wailing in her arms)</i> The put-upon Mom, <i>(switch to Tenzin's three older children and Meelo tries to entertain his sisters by shoving chopsticks in his mouth to look like a beaver)</i> crazy kids. <i>(view returns back to Bolin and Korra with Asami in the background)</i> This is great. <i>(Jinora takes a bite from her bowl of rice)</i>         <br><b>Asami:</b> Where's Mako?         <br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(puts his rice bowl down)</i> Oh, you mean the brooding teenager? He's staying at the police station.     <br><b>Korra:</b> Still?            <br><b>Bolin:</b> I told him Tenzin invited us to stay here since our apartment is a vine habitat now, but he said <i>(runs a hand into his fringe and pushes it up to look like Mako's hairdo)</i> he had to focus on work.   <br><br><i>(Bolin uses his hand to returns his hair back to normal and camera pans left to Bumi with his hands outstretched towards a napkin.)</i>      <br> <br><b>Bumi:</b> Oh! Did you see that? I think the napkin moved!       <br><b>Kya:</b> <i>(dryly)</i> You blew on it.           <br><b>Bumi:</b> Wait! <i>(puts a hand on his chin in thought)</i> Maybe I can only do it when my life is in danger. Bolin, <i>(gets into a bending stance with his arms)</i> bend a giant boulder at me.           <br><b>Bolin:</b> Yeah, I don't think that's a good idea.  <br><br><i>(Camera pans out to a full view of the dining table and we can see Tenzin with his hands on his face.)</i>     <br><br><b>Pema:</b> If you're gonna be bending giant boulders, you can do it outside.     <br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(slams both hands on the table)</i> No one is bending giant boulders! <i>(Meelo stands up)</i>         <br><b>Meelo:</b> <i>(slams a hand down on the table)</i> Look alive, <i>(a plate is thrown up from the force)</i> Uncle Bumi!<br><br><i>(Meelo grabs the plate and tosses it. Camera follows the plate and we cut to Bumi as he shuts his eyes and moves his hands in front of him protectively. A bubble of air surrounds the plate.)</i>       <br><br><b>Bumi:</b> Ah! <i>(opens his eyes)</i> I told you! <br><br><i>(Camera cuts to Kya and Meelo with their jaws dropped. View changes to Bolin, Korra, Ikki, Jinora, and Asami who are all equally astonished. Cut to Tenzin and his wife. Rohan looks happy and entertained.)</i>          <br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(in awe)</i> Unbelievable. You're actually an airbender.  <br><br><i>(Switch to a full view of the dining room again as Bumi continues to balance the spinning plate within the swirling bubble of air.)</i><br><br><b>Bumi:</b> Wait until I tell Mom. She's gonna love this.     <br><br><i>(Bumi stops airbending and the plate falls and shatters on the dining table. Everyone looks down at fragmented plate. Cut to commercial break.)</i><br><br><br><br><b><u>Act II</u></b><br><br><i>(Episode returns to a shot of the Republic City police station at night. Cut to a phone ringing on a desk in the station. The table moves up and we can hear someone bumping into it from under the table.)</i> <br><br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> Ow! <br><br><i>(A hand reaches up to find the phone on the table and Mako pushes himself into view a few moments later, his hair is all messed up and he's in his pajamas. He rubs his head for a second before picking up the phone.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Police. <i>(change to a view from the other side of Mako's desk and we can see a mattress under the table)</i> He what? Slow down. Okay, I'm on my way.      <br><br><i>(Scene changes to the camera facing the door. We can see a wrecked shelf with broken glass off to the side. The door slides open to reveal Mako in his police uniform.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(walks in and looks around)</i> What the heck <i>(view changes to the back of Mako's head looking into the shop and we can see the shopkeeper trying to tidy up his shop littered with debris)</i> did all this?   <br><b>Shopkeeper:</b> <i>(throws his mop aside and runs up to Mako)</i> It was my brother. He's out of control!      <br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(pulls out a notepad from his side pouch)</i> Okay, just tell me what happened. <i>(pulls out the pencil)</i>         <br><b>Shopkeeper:</b> We were arguing about the books, <i>(Mako jots down on the notepad)</i> and Daw was yelling at me, and all of a sudden things started flying around! He was creating this storm like...             <br><b>Mako:</b> Like what?          <br><b>Shopkeeper:</b> Well, like he was airbending.     <br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(raises an eyebrow)</i> Sir... That's impossible. There are only <i>five</i> airbenders in the entire World, and your brother is not one of them.       <br><b>Shopkeeper:</b> I know what I saw. He was freaking out, yelling, "What's happening to me?!" Then, <i>(gestures to the back of the shop)</i> he ran into the back room and locked himself in.       <br><br><i>(Switch to the back room's door as Mako walks up to it and knocks.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Police. Open up.          <br><b>Daw:</b> <i>(off-screen, voice muffled from being inside the room)</i> Go away!              <br><b>Mako:</b> Get out here, Sir, or I'm knocking this door down. <i>(cut to a frontal shot of Mako's face as he gets serious)</i> One... Two... <br><br><i>(A gust of air comes into view and Mako is slammed backwards a few feet by the door. He falls to the ground with the door on top of him. Cut to Daw who is perspiring and shaking.)</i>            <br><br><b>Daw:</b> Ah! <i>(clutches his head)</i> I'm so sorry!  <br><br><i>(He runs off, past Mako on the floor, and out of the door. Daw accidentally jumps up with airbending, still screaming in fright. Mako sits up and pushes the door off him. His face is red from the impact.)</i>        <br><br><b>Shopkeeper:</b> <i>(runs and squats down next to Mako)</i> I told you! Airbending! <i>(Mako rubs his face and sighs)</i>          <br><br><i>(Scene changes to the next morning with Kya looking at Bumi attempting to airbend in the courtyard on Air Temple Island. Switch to a full view of the courtyard as everyone spectates. Bumi tries valiantly to airbend but nothing happens.)</i><br><br><b>Bumi:</b> Ugh! I can't figure this thing out! <br><br><i>(Cut to a close up profile shot of Korra and Tenzin.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Do you think being in the Spirit World during Harmonic Convergence could have given him bending?     <br><b>Tenzin:</b> I suppose it's <i>possible</i>.     <br><b>Ikki:</b> <i>(cut to Ikki seated on the ground)</i> Maybe Uncle Bumi is just a late bloomer.     <br><br><i>(Return back to Bumi and his sister. Kya stretches her arms forward and moves it in the air in front of Bumi.)</i><br><br><b>Kya:</b> I have been noticing a change in your aura lately.  <br><b>Bumi:</b> And you didn't tell me?    <br><br><i>(Bumi steps off and continues to do airbending movements. Kya is disappointed by his behavior. From behind her, Lin and Mako walk in. Both cops stare at Bumi's antics.)</i>   <br><br><b>Lin:</b> <i>(walks to Tenzin and turns around to continue looking at Bumi)</i> Invisible spirit monster attack?     <br><b>Tenzin:</b> Lin! You won't believe this. Bumi just started airbending. <br><br><i>(Lin and Mako raise their eyebrows and they look at each other. They then turn around to face Tenzin.)</i> <br><br><b>Lin:</b> I'm afraid he's not the <i>only</i> one.     <br><b>Tenzin, Korra, and Asami:</b> <i>(simultaneously)</i> What?              <br><b>Mako:</b> I got a call last night about a guy who just started <i>airbending</i> out of nowhere.      <br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(walks towards the cops)</i> You mean there's another one? Where is he now?        <br><b>Mako:</b> He... blew a door down on me and got away. We've got an all-points bulletin out on him right now. <i>(Lin and Mako start to walk off)</i>     <br><b>Korra:</b> Wait, <i>(Mako stops in his tracks)</i> we'll help you look for him. Where should we start?     <br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(rubs the back of his neck)</i> Oh, well, <i>(walks to Korra)</i> you know, you should... <i>(awkwardly)</i> You should leave it to the police. It's... police business, you know. It's, um... official.   <br><br><i>(Switch to a view of Tenzin, Asami, and Korra looking at Mako with incredulous looks.)</i>   <br><br><b>Korra:</b> Okay. <i>(Tenzin sticks out his tongue and comically slides off-screen)</i> How are you doing? You know you're welcome to stay here instead of sleeping at the police station.     <br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(still awkward)</i> No, <i>(gives a forced smile)</i> I'm fine. I should just... get... <i>(glances at Korra and Asami nervously)</i> going. So! As you were... <i>(salutes)</i> Ladies. <br><br><i>(Mako walks off stiffly. Asami and Korra share a look.<br><br>Location changes to an area near the docks where Korra and Asami walk up to Asami's Satomobile.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> This is so exciting! <i>(cut to a close up of the car as Korra walks to the passenger's seat.)</i> New airbenders in the city? I bet we can find that guy before Mako does. <i>(Asami tosses a set of car keys over to Korra from off-screen and Korra catches it, looking at the keys uncertainly)</i> You know I'm not very good at this.      <br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(cut to a close up of Asami who smiles)</i> You're the Avatar, master of all the elements. You should know how to drive. Besides, <i>(flips her hair)</i> it's <i>relaxing</i>.     <br><br><i>(Camera fades to a shot of Asami looking terrified as the Satomobile moves.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> Clutch! <i>(the vehicle brakes and jerks suddenly)</i> Clutch! <i>(the car jerks again)</i> <br><br><i>(Cut to a full view of the Satomobile as it keeps inching forward and jerking. Another vehicle brakes suddenly behind them and horns. Cut to a frontal shot of the girls.)</i>                <br><br><b>Asami:</b> That's the brake. <i>(looks to Korra)</i> Let's try again. <i>(Korra glances at her friend nervously)</i> You ready? <br><br><i>(The vehicle behinds them horns in an "ahwooga" noise. Korra gives a salute, surprising Asami a bit. The girls laugh and the car still honks impatiently.)</i>             <br><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(turns the ignition key)</i> How long do you think talking to Mako is going to be like pulling teeth?       <br><b>Asami:</b> Well, Mako <i>(the Satomobile behind decides to change lanes and move past them)</i> has never been the most <i>(switch to profile shots of the girls as an old man in the Satomobile glares at them)</i> "in touch with his feelings" guy. <i>(Korra begins to drive forward)</i> But, it'll get better eventually.           <br><b>Korra:</b> So when I was gone, did he tell you that we broke up?           <br><b>Asami:</b> Yeah. We all knew. Sorry.             <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(blushes)</i> That's pretty embarrassing.  <br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(gets uncomfortable)</i> Actually, I need to tell you something about that, <i>(awkwardly)</i> and I should've told you this sooner, but...While you were gone, I... kind of... kissed him. I'm sorry. <i>(looks to Asami)</i>              <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(laughs)</i> No wonder he's so nervous around us.              <br><b>Asami:</b> You're not mad?         <br><b>Korra:</b> No! I mean, I kissed Mako when he was going out with you, so. <br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(frowns)</i> You what?           <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(aghast)</i> I'm so sorry! I thought you knew!       <br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(gives a sly smile)</i> I'm just kidding. I knew a long time ago.     <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(relaxes her posture and laughs)</i> Well, whatever happened with Mako, I'm glad it hasn't come between us. <i>(switch back to a frontal shot of the girls)</i> I've never had a girl friend to hang out with and talk to before, except for Naga. <i>(looks to Asami)</i> This is nice.      <br><br><i>(Asami notices something in front of them and she exclaims.)</i>    <br><br><b>Asami:</b> Vine! Vine!          <br><br><i>(Korra tugs on the steering wheel and the Satomobile swerves, stopping just in time in front of a huge vine habitat. A porcupine-like spirit materializes on top of the vine and Asami gasps.)</i><br><br><b>Fruithog:</b> Hey! Watch where you're going!       <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(points to the spirit)</i> What are you doing <i>(stands up)</i> living in the middle of the road in the first place?       <br><b>Fruithog:</b> <i>(puts a hand on its chest)</i> Don't ask me, Avatar. <i>(points to Korra)</i> <i>You</i> made the world this way, we're just living in it.  <br><b>Korra:</b> Look, I don't have anything against spirits, but <i>(points to the Spirit Wilds)</i> these vines are causing <i>major</i> problems all over the city.          <br><b>Fruithog:</b> Spirits? Vines? <i>(turns away)</i> We're all the same. Seems like the Avatar would <i>know</i> that. <i>(walks away and disappears)</i>       <br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(Korra sits down in the driver's seat in thought)</i> Korra, you okay?          <br><b>Korra:</b> I think that spirit just gave me an idea how to get rid of these vines. <i>(puts a hand on her chin)</i> But I'm gonna need a lot of water.       <br><i>(Cut to Tenzin sitting down on a hill overlooking Avatar Aang Memorial Island.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> It's like a dream, Dad. After 170 years, new airbenders.         <br><b>Ikki:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> Dad? <i>(Tenzin turns to the side. Switch to a full view of Tenzin as his children run up to him.

You're an airbender now, and there are thousands of years of culture you must learn about. Skills you must master.     <br><b>Kuon:</b> You expect me to abandon my entire life? My family? No! <i>(stands up)</i> No, sir!

They must come freely. But not to worry, <i>(smiles hopefully)</i> there are plenty of other airbenders out there who will be happy to come with us once they find out what the Air Nation's all about.   <br><i>(Cut to a cartoon version of the World map with all of the crew represented as cute emojis of themselves on a ship with happy expression on their faces.

You know him as the son of Avatar Aang. <i>(camera pans to the stairs behind him and Tenzin's back is to the audience)</i> He shaves every hair on his head, every single day. <i>(cut to a back view of Tenzin)</i> It's the one, the only guy with an arrow pointing to his nose- <i>(Tenzin turns towards the audience and pulls off his robes, revealing his shirtless form)</i> Tenzin!             <br><br><i>(Tenzin waves his arms around and forms his air cycle that hasn't been seen since Book 1. He moves the cycle along the ground in front of the audience and the crowd applauds.

We've heard that an escaped firebending convict has been spotted near here. <i>(everyone starts to whisper)</i> Now, I don't want to panic anyone, <i>(goes up really close to a couple in front)</i> but if you see a <i>firebender</i> <i>(Cut to Mako with his arms crossed behind a couple of people in the crowd.

Mako gasps with surprise. She releases him and he almost drops to the ground before he gets caught on a bed of air. Korra makes the vortex typhoon again and spins Mako around.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Whoa! Aah! Oh! Aah! Aah! Hey! Let me go! <i>(cut to the top view of the vortex to show Mako as he looks panicked)</i> This is not what we rehearsed! Korra!         <br><br><i>(Cut to Korra who chuckles as she is enjoying herself. She looks backwards and the camera pans to the side to reveal Asami who laughs in amusement too. Cut to a view of Oogi as it sails through the air.)</i>    <br><br><b>Bolin:</b> With the power of airbending, even this beast can float like a feather! <i>(cut to Bumi on the ground as he thrusts out four gusts of air from his palms)</i> Look what can be done in only a few short weeks of practice. <i>(Jinora flies above the crows with her glider and bobs and weaves for a moment before twirling her glider in the air and landing gently on top of a column)</i> No, no, don't worry, folks, she might be young, but she is in full control. <br><br><i>(The crowd applauds for Jinora and we switch back to an aerial view of the group.)</i>  <br> <br><b>Bolin:</b> Ladies and gentlemen, if you or anyone you know is an airbender, <i>(Bumi and Korra give a wave)</i> please send them our way. Master Tenzin and Avatar Korra would love to teach them all they know.     <br><br><i>(Switch to Korra giving Tenzin a hopeful smile. Return back to a shot of the crowd as they disperse but a figure runs up to them. Cut to a close up of a boy with green eyes around the age of ten running towards Team Avatar.)</i>    <br><br><b>Kai:</b> Hey. Hello. If you're looking for airbenders, you just found one. <i>(camera zooms out to the back of Korra and Tenzin's heads as the boy thrusts his palms out and airbends twice)</i> I want to join you guys.   <br><br><i>(View changes to the back of the Kai's head looking to Team Avatar who smile with delight.)</i><br> <br><b>Bolin:</b> Get outta town!           <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(she walks up to Tenzin and smiles)</i> We got our first recruit.   <br><br><i>(Both of them grin and then look at the camera hopefully.

All that sound good to you?   <br><b>Kai:</b> <i>(repeats without thought)</i> Yeah, Ba Sing Se, rebuild the temple, Air Nomad whaddyado- I'm in. Let's go right now.       <br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(jumps for joy)</i> This is going to be so great! You are gonna love it- <i>(raises his eyebrows)</i> Uh, ah- Real quick, what's your name?  <br><b>Kai:</b> Kai. <i>(to Tenzin)</i> So when do we hit the road?               <br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(raises a hand up as a 'stop' gesture)</i> Hang on a second, Kai. Where are your parents? <i>(cut to Kai who looks saddened)</i> We can't have you come with us without their permission.       <br><b>Kai:</b> <i>(looks down)</i> My parents are... <i>(sighs)</i> gone.  <br><br><i>(Switch to Korra looking at Tenzin worriedly. Camera pans right to Mako and Bolin.)</i>  <br><br><b>Bolin:</b> You're an orphan?       <br><b>Kai:</b> <i>(nods and sad music begins to play)</i> It happened about a year ago. My hometown was raided by outlaws, but my parents fought back against them. <i>(camera pans across the other who listen intently)</i> I was so scared, but they told me not to worry. They would protect me. And they did. My parents saved me <i>and</i> the entire village, but they died in the fight. <i>(cut to Korra and the brothers as tears well up in Bolin's eyes)</i> Mom and Pop meant everything to me. They were my whole life.    <br><br><i>(Bolin sniffles and wipes a tear from his eye.)</i><br><br><b>Kai:</b> Ever since then, I've been on my own and on the run. Those <i>same</i> outlaws are <i>still</i> after me.       <br><b>Bolin:</b> Well, you don't have to be on the run anymore. Right, guys? Tell him.               <br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(solemnly)</i> I'm so sorry about your parents. I know we could never replace them, <i>(rests a hand on Kai's shoulder)</i> but we're here for you.     <br><b>Korra:</b> We'll keep you safe. <i>(gestures to the ramp)</i> Come on. <i>(everyone except Bolin walk up the ramp)</i>            <br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(rests an arm across Kai's back)</i> When you board this airship, you're gonna leave your old life behind and start a new path. That's some big brother advice. <i>(he and Kai walk up the ramp to board the ship)</i> Just think of me as your big brother.      <br><br><i>(Kai smiles gleefully as they leave. Cut to the inside of the entrance as Mako pauses and walks to a nearby window. The revving of motorcycle engines can be heard and five motorcycles can be seen pulling up to the area where the team was just at.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Guys, I think we got trouble. <br><br><i>(Cut to the rest of the gang as they turn around with worried faces. Scene changes to a back view of the Sheriff on his bike as he stops the engine, parks, and gets off the vehicle. He walks forward, pushing his goggles up to his helmet before removing his headgear.)</i><br><br><b>Sheriff:</b> Release the boy <i>(raises an arm up)</i> or we'll take him by force.   <br><br><i>(The Sheriff clenches his hands and the other four deputies earthbend one rock each from the ground.

The deputies immediately launch their rocks to Korra but the Avatar breaks them with a blast of air. Korra lands on the ground and pushes herself up before kicking her legs out and airbending the Sheriff and his deputies off their feet. The Sheriff lands near a fountain and he quickly stands up, earthbending a piece of rock with him and he sends to to Korra. She quickly bends up a column of earth to intercept the projectile. <br><br>The Sheriff sends another rock chunk at Korra and she stretches a hand out, bending the rock into dust. Korra earthbends an underground snake towards the Sheriff, knocking him backwards to a nearby fountain while the rest of his deputies remain unconscious on the ground near him.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(stands up and frowns)</i> Your days of harassing an innocent boy are over. <i>(walks to the Sheriff)</i> You outlaws are going to prison.<br><br><i>(Cut to the Sheriff who is surprised)</i><br><br><b>Sheriff:</b> Outlaws? Innocent boy? <i>(looks down at his badge)</i> I'm a sheriff and these are my deputies. <i>(cut to Korra who is shocked and we can see Jinora and Tenzin behind her)</i> And this kid is a thief. <i>(Korra widens her eyes and view returns back to the Sheriff)</i> Whatever he told you is a lie. We've been chasing him for months.           <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(her expression of shock changes to anger and she looks back to her team mates)</i> Where's Kai?         <br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(off screen)</i> Right here. <i>(Camera pans to the left to reveal Mako with Kai's satchel in one hand and holding onto Kai's collar in the other. They walk towards Korra.)</i> I found him slipping away.      <br><b>Kai:</b> I was going to the bathroom. <br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(lifts up a satchel for emphasis)</i> With your sack of gold?       <br><br><i>(Mako tosses the sack towards the lawmen. The bag lands on the ground at Korra's feet and gold and jewellery fall out from it. Camera pans up as Korra has an unreadable expression on her face.)</i><br><br><b>Kai:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> I told you, I found that on the road!<br><br><i>(Pan out to a full view of Team Avatar, the Sheriff and his colleagues surrounding Mako and Kai.)</i>       <br><br><b>Mako:</b> Enough with the lies, kid. I want the truth.           <br><b>Sheriff:</b> <i>(arms akimbo)</i> The truth is, <i>he's</i> the outlaw. <i>(Korra turns her head towards the boy)</i> He spent his entire life as an orphan until <i>(Two deputies step forward, forcing Mako to let go of Kai. The deputies stand on each side of Kai, grabbing hold of his arm)</i> he got adopted by a real nice family about six months ago. <i>(switch to a close up of the Sheriff and Korra as she turns towards him)</i> And how did he repay them? By taking their entire life savings. <i>(turns to Korra)</i> We've been after him ever since.           <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(to Kai)</i> Is that true?         <br><b>Kai:</b> <i>(pleads with puppy dog eyes)</i> The person who stole that stuff was the <i>old</i> me. Once I got airbending, <i>(opens his palms)</i> I changed. I don't know how to explain it, <i>(camera pans across to Bolin with his hands clasped together while Jinora looks at the scene sadly)</i> but I feel like airbending chose me for a reason. Like I'm a new person. I'm sorry! <i>(he drags his feet on the ground as the deputies lead him away)</i> Please! You have to listen to me.       <br><br><i>(One of the deputies picks up the sack of gold and he walks off with the Sheriff.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(sadly)</i> Are you taking him back to the orphanage?           <br><b>Sheriff:</b> No. He's headed to jail.      <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(Korra looks down to think for a moment)</i> Wait! <i>(the rest of the crew look at her with surprise)</i> You guys <i>(the lawmen glance back at her)</i> got the family's life savings back. Now let us take Kai.      <br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(to Korra)</i> Do you really want our first new member of the Air Nation to be a liar and a thief?       <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(smiles at her teacher)</i> He just needs some guidance, Tenzin. And who better to give it to him than us?         <br><b>Sheriff:</b> Do you want this kid or not? <br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(scratches his beard in thought)</i> Yes. <i>(Bolin smiles in the background)</i> You can release the boy into our custody.       <br><br><i>(Cut to Kai who looks ecstatic.

Bumi gives Tenzin a hug, much to his brother's disdain. Cut to the Team boarding the ship again as the Sheriff and his colleagues drive off on their motorbikes.

I know <i>exactly</i> what you're all about because I've been there before. You don't have me fooled.       <br><b>Kai:</b> <i>(takes a step back with both hands out in front of him in a protective gesture)</i> Whoa, hey, lighten up. <i>(puts his hands in his pockets)</i> I'm turning over a new leaf. Making a change. <i>(turns away)</i> Don't you worry about me.     <br><br><i>(Kai walks up the plank and the camera follows him up the ramp to reveal Jinora shyly waiting for him in the middle of the walkway.)</i>  <br><br><b>Jinora:</b> Hi, I'm Jinora. <i>(cut to a close up of the two as Jinora blushes and we can see Tenzin walking into the airship in the background)</i> If you need any help with airbending I could show you what I know.  <br><b>Kai:</b> <i>(tugs on his suspenders)</i> Thanks. <i>(Tenzin appears in the doorway again)</i> That's real nice of you.    <br><b>Tenzin:</b> Jinora! <i>(the two children are startled and they look at him)</i> We're leaving now.          <br><br><i>(Jinora smiles at Kai.

And Zaheer is an airbender now.           <br><b>Lord Zuko:</b> <i>(camera angle changes to a full shot of Zuko as he reacts with surprise)</i> No! This can't be. Do you have <i>any</i> idea the power these criminals possess? Individually, they can take down any bender. Put them all together, they could take down the entire <i>World</i>.  And now you're telling me their leader is an <i>airbender</i>?  <br><b>White Lotus Guard #3:</b> We can track them...     <br><b>Lord Zuko:</b> We don't need to track them. <i>(turns away from the guard)</i> I know exactly where they're going. <i>(Zuko begins to walk off screen and the White Lotus guard follows.

Hou-Ting raises up her left arm and makes a shooing gesture. Gun panicks a bit and turns Korra around, attempting to show her out. Korra shoves Gun away and he trips, falling to his feet off-screen and one shoe comically flies. The Queen smiles.<br><br>Scene changes to a butterfly sitting on a lotus flower floating on a pond.

Oh, I think <i>(tries to stretch his shoulders)</i> I slipped a disc sleeping here. It's been a while <i>(reaches behind him and pulls out a can from his coat)</i> since we spent the night on a trash pile. <i>(Mako wakes up and wipes away the drool on his chin)</i> It's about how I remembered.  <br><br><i>(Mako stands up.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> I bet everyone's freaking out that we've been gone all night. <i>(he flicks the banana peel off his head)</i><br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(looks out of the alley)</i> I'm worried about Kai.

Korra stops them by bending a gust of air and knocks them away.<br><br>Cut to Asami running towards a pair of gangsters and the passenger swings his spear at Asami. The teen jumps up, over the spear and past their heads. Frame rate slows slightly as she extends her gloved hand out and touches the passenger's shoulder, electrocuting him.

The third sends an arc of air and stretches one arm out in anticipation of another attack. Soon after, he gets hit by a disc.

We should get moving.<br><b>Korra:</b> Relax, we just got here. Besides, no one knows where I am right now except us. <br><br><i>(Naga returns and drops a ball to Lin's feet.

Where are they?<br><b>Mako:</b> A city called Zaofu, <i>(Lin is visibly uncomfortable)</i> the home of The Metal Clan.<br><b>Korra:</b> You know the place?<br><b>Lin:</b> <i>(crosses her arms uneasily)</i> Er, never been. But I <i>don't want</i> you going there. I'd rest a lot easier if you were back safe in Republic City. <br><b>Korra:</b> Sorry, but if there's an airbender in Zaofu, then that's where we're going next. <br><br><i>(Lin glares to the side. Naga bends down and nudges the ball to Lin with her nose. The metalbender regards the polar-bear dog for a moment before bending out her cable, slapping it against the ball as it punctures and deflates. Naga looks down at the deflated ball and lowers herself down, pawing at it, attempting to roll it on the ground. She makes a sad whining noise and her tail sags.<br><br>Cut to an aerial view of the plains with the airship flying through the clouds. As the clouds past, a huge gleaming city made entirely out of metal in the shape of a lotus flower is seen. There are smaller metal flowers around the city too.

It's metal, big whoop. Just find the airbender and let's get moving. <i>(points to the team)</i> And don't tell <i>anyone</i> I'm here. <br><b>Korra:</b> Why not? <br><b>Lin:</b> I don't need to explain myself to you, just <i>do</i> what I say. <br><b>Korra:</b>  Fine. <i>(rolls her eyes and walks away)</i> You got it, Chief Crankypants.<br><br><i>(Outside, the team walk up to a man in green and yellow robes flanked by guards.)</i><br><br><b>Aiwei:</b> Avatar Korra, it is an honor to meet you. <i>(bows with his hands clasped)</i> My name is Aiwei. <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(returns the bow)</i> Thanks for having us. <br><b>Aiwei:</b> Is this everyone? <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(looks behind)</i> Yup! <i>(looks back at Aiwei)</i> Just us.

How exciting, new friends.<br><b>Zaheer:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> Excuse me, hello? <i>(he opens a door to the side and we can see he is hooded)</i> My name is You Ru, <i>(pushes down his hood and he is now bald and clean shaven)</i> I heard this was the place to come if you're a new airbender. <br><b>Meelo:</b> You got that right, stranger.<br><b>Zaheer:</b> Well, a couple of weeks ago, I woke up and suddenly I could do this. <br><br><i>(Zaheer airbends a small little cyclone on his palm)</i><br><br><b>Ikki:</b> <i>(hollers excitedly)</i> Mom! <i>(Pema and Kya who are seated in the background glance over)</i> Aunt Kya! <i>(raises both arms with glee)</i> We got another one!<br><br><i>(Zaheer gives a smile. Cut back to a scenic view of Zaofu and camera angle changes to inside the city where a tram passes by on a rail line. Cut to Team Avatar inside the tram with Aiwei. Bolin is pressed up against the window as he marvels at the city. We are shown a little more of the city where its citizens wear uniform green and silver robes. The tram continues to move along the rail and camera cuts to a statue of Toph with her arms raised, holding an up an intricate octagon.)</i><br><br><b>Aiwei:</b> That statue honors the first metalbender, Toph Bei Fong, who expanded the possibilities of what benders were capable of. Here, <i>everyone</i> is encouraged to reach his or her highest potential.<br><b>Bolin:</b> Does Toph live here?! Are we gonna get to meet her??<br><b>Aiwei:</b> I'm afraid not. She used to visit from time to time but years ago, she left to wander the World, in search of enlightenment. No one has seen her since.<br><br><i>(The team looks a little downcast and the tram is shrouded in darkness as it enters a tunnel. Cut to an aerial view of the rail line as the tram makes its way to another metal flower. The tram comes to a stop at the end. Camera shows an overhead view of this flower which has numerous terraced slopes along with various buildings like a house, courtyard, waterfall, arena, lake, and a small stadium.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Wow. Is this where the airbender lives? <br><b>Aiwei:</b> Yes. But first, her mother wants to meet you. <br><br><i>(Cut to the inside of a building as the team enters it. Camera pans to the middle of a room with a group of dancers standing on a small metal flower prop.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Training? <br><b>Aiwei:</b> Not exactly. They're rehearsing for a dance premiere next month.<br><br><i>(The troupe begins an intricate dance as dancers fall from the ceiling and land on the flower petals which bend upwards to bounce the dancers around. A pair of girls hold hands as they drop down into a flower which closes its petals immediately. Then the petals open up to reveal the girls with one leg raised up and crossed in an X-shape while the girls' arms are in a pose. Cut to a woman in her forties. She looks behind to see that she has guests.)</i><br><br><b>Su:</b> <i>(claps her hands)</i> That's it for today, everyone.<br><br><i>(She walks up to the Team)</i><br><br><b>Aiwei:</b> Allow me to introduce the matriach of The Metal Clan, Su Yin.<br><b>Su:</b> Please, call me Su. <i>(presses a fist into her palm as a greeting)</i> Great to finally meet you, Avatar Korra. <i>(Camera pans out to the rest of the Team and Korra is bowing too)</i> And this must be Mako, Bolin, and Asami.<br><b>Mako:</b> You've done your research. <br><b>Su:</b> I make it my business to know who's visiting my city. <br><b>Korra:</b> So, you're a dancer?<br><b>Su:</b> <i>(begins to count with her fingers)</i> Dancer, leader, wife, mother, collector of rare meteorites. You'll find people here have many skills and interest.<br><br><i>(Aiwei leans into Su's ear and begins to whisper. Su's eyes widen and she narrows them suspiciously.)</i><br><br><b>Su:</b> Korra, why did you lie when Aiwei asked if there was anyone else with you?<br><br><i>(Cut to Korra who is surprised. Behind her, Bolin claps a hand over his mouth and he is nervous.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> What? I- I didn't. I mean...<br><b>Bolin:</b> Oh...<br><b>Korra:</b> How did you know I was lying? <br><b>Aiwei:</b> I am a Truth Seer. When people lie, their heart rate and breathing increase. <i>(Camera pans across Team Avatar who are bewildered)</i> I can sense the most <i>subtle</i> of changes. <br><b>Su:</b> Thanks to Aiwei, there are no secrets in our city. <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(relents and is remorseful)</i> We came with Republic City's Chief of Police. She didn't want anyone to know she was here. I'm sorry I didn't tell you. <br><b>Su:</b> <i>(excitedly)</i> Lin's here? Well, I would love to say hello. <br><b>Korra:</b> Wait, you two know each other?<br><b>Su:</b> You're joking, right? <br><br><i>(There's silence from the teens as they stare at each other awkwardly. Su sighs and looks to the side sadly)</i> <br><br><b>Su:</b> Lin never told you about me. <br><b>Korra:</b> No... why would she?<br><b>Su:</b> I'm Lin's sister.<br><br><i>(The team are slack jawed. Cut to Lin who has pressed an arm on the airship's window and is looking out at Zaofu.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> I found out <i>(Lin turns back in alarm)</i> why you were so against coming here. <i>(View changes to show the Team and Su on the ship)</i> Why didn't you ever tell me you had a sister? <br><b>Lin:</b> <i>(crosses her arms)</i> <i>Half</i>-sister. <br><b>Su:</b> Same Mom, different Dads. So what? <i>(puts her hand over her heart)</i> We're blood Lin, and after thirty years, the least you could do is say hello.<br><b>Lin:</b> <i>(Cut to Lin who turns away from Su)</i> I have <i>nothing</i> to say to you.<br><br><i>(Camera angle changes to a close up of an angry Lin with the rest of the party looking sad in the background.

My daughter is thrilled to meet you.<br><b>Korra:</b><i>(Korra smiles and turns towards the Chief)</i>  Lin, your niece is the new airbender! Isn't that amazing? <br><b>Lin:</b> <i>(Cut to Lin who looks bored)</i> Yeah. Terrific. <br><br><i>(Location changes to a small arena as the party watches from above. Two boys bend a metal disc around three pillars in the middle of the arena.)</i><br><br><b>Su:</b> Those are my two youngest, Wei and Wing. They're playing a game called Power Disc, they invented it all on their own.<br><br><i>(Camera angle changes to Wing as he kicks the disc away. His brother Wei manages to deflect it with a kick of his own. Cut to an area inside Wing's goal post as it flies straight in. Wing attempts to catch the disc but he is too late. Cut to the nets in the goal post as a red buzzer above it rings and flashes red. We cut back to Wing on the ground as he pounds his hands in defeat.)</i><br><br><b>Su:</b> Oh nice power, Wei.<br><br><i>(Wei cheers for himself)</i><br><br><b>Wei:</b> Ha! Wing goes down!<br><b>Su:</b> I'm so proud of those two.<br><br><i>(The Team walks away and we cut to an open air courtyard littered with various metal sculptures. A teenaged boy wearing green and silver robes is seen metalbending a sculpture. Cut to a frontal shot of Huan who has a piercing on his eyebrow. He eyeballs his sculpture with a hand on his mouth.)</i><br><br><b>Su:</b> Huan, I want you to meet the Avatar and her friends, and your Aunt Lin.<br><b>Korra:</b> Nice to meet you. <br><b>Huan:</b> <i>(he doesn't turn back to greet them properly)</i> Hey. <br><b>Bolin:</b> Wow, that's a really nice... banana? Yes, very- very life-like.<br><br><i>(Cut to Huan's back view)</i><br><br><b>Huan:</b> <i>(sighs)</i> It's not a banana! <i>(turns to Bolin and speaks irritably)</i> I was inspired by Harmonic Convergence. It represents the dawning of a new age. Obviously.<br><b>Bolin:</b> Oh yeah, no, I could- I could totally see that. <i>(Mako and Asami look amused in the background and they start walking off)</i> Oh, let me stand here, yes, I could see that now. Yes. Thank you. <i>(whispers to Mako)</i> Banana. I mean that's a banana, right?<br><br><i>(Cut to a view of a mountain and camera pans down to a slightly younger teenaged girl dressed in green reading a book on a bench.)</i><br><br><b>Su:</b> And this is my daughter, Opal. <br><b>Opal:</b> <i>(turns towards the guests)</i> Wow, Avatar Korra. <i>(stands up)</i> I can't believe you're really here. You are so amazing. <br><b>Korra:</b> It's great to meet you, Opal.<br><b>Bolin:</b> Opal.

Let's take her back to the airship and get out of here. <br><b>Su:</b> And the woman apparently trying to abduct you is your Aunt Lin.<br><b>Opal:</b> <i>(excited)</i> Really? I've always wanted to meet you! My Mom has told me so many stories about you.<br><b>Lin:</b> <i>(replies coldly)</i> I'm sure she has.<br><br><i>(Opal looks confused by Lin's behavior)</i><br><br><b>Su:</b> So I've set all of you up in the guest houses while Korra trains Opal.<br><b>Korra:</b> Oh, I'm sorry. But I was hoping she could train with rest of the airbenders at the Northern Temple. <br><b>Opal:</b> That sounds amazing!<br><b>Su:</b> Nonsense. This is where Opal's home and family are, you can train her here. <br><b>Korra:</b> I guess I could help her get started.<br><b>Lin:</b> Absolutely not! We're leaving. <br><b>Korra:</b> She's just a little worried because there are a bunch of crazy criminals after me. <br><b>Su:</b> If you're concerned about security, don't be. <i>(Lin rolls her eyes)</i> This is the safest city in the World. Now I will see you all at dinner and come hungry, my chef will blow the taste buds right out of your mouth.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(smiles at Lin)</i> Why do you have such a problem with your sister? She seems nice. Come on, we can stay a little while.<br><br><i>(Lin looks to the side and growls. Cut to a pavilion area above a waterfall at sunset.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Okay, let's see what you got.<br><b>Opal:</b> I'm not very good. <br><b>Korra:</b> That's okay. I've never been a teacher before so, we're in the same boat. <i>(puts her arms out, one in front and one slightly behind)</i> You want to keep your elbows in, <i>(camera pans out as Korra demonstrates the air walk)</i> torso straight, feet <i>just</i> skimming the ground. <br><br><i>(Opal watches with her hands behind her)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Why don't you try it with me?<br><br><i>(Opal mimicks Korra and walks as well. They then face each other and walk in a circle. Then, both girls perform some bending movements with their arms and gently bend arcs of air around them. Both arcs join each other and encircle both of them as they continue to walk around in a circle.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Wow, you're a natural. <br><b>Opal:</b> You really think so? Thanks. <br><br><i>(Cut an overhead view of both of them as they continue to walk before bending and making the air spin the other direction. Camera fades in to the spinning gates at Air Temple Island. A new airbender walks in but gets tossed and smacked around by the gates. She returns back out to Meelo, a little disoriented as she drops to the ground and rubs her head.)</i><br><br><b>Meelo:</b> You call yourself an airbender? Disgraceful! <br><br><i>(He looks to Daw and points off-screen as a silent gesture to Daw that he's up next. Daw runs into the gates and smacks himself on it, being tossed around briefly before he is thrown back out. Meelo looms over Daw angrily.)</i><br><br><b>Meelo:</b> Be the leaf!<br><b>Daw:</b> But, I don't know what that means!<br><br><i>(Zaheer steps out and navigates through the gates with ease. Kya joins her nephew and watches. Zaheer does the kung fu salute to Meelo and walks up to the boy.)</i><br><br><b>Meelo:</b> Now that man's a leaf!<br><b>Zaheer:</b> <i>(he presses both fists together and bows)</i> A student is only as good as his master. <br><br><i>(Meelo returns the bow)</i><br><br><b>Kya:</b> <i>(excited)</i> Great news! I just got a message from Tenzin, he's with a whole group of other airbenders at the Northern Temple and he wants all of you to join them! We leave first thing in the morning.<br><b>Zaheer:</b> <i>(asks curiously)</i> And the Avatar is with them?<br><br><i>(Kya looks at him oddly)</i><br><br><b>Kya:</b> No... apparently she had to split off from Tenzin.<br><b>Zaheer:</b> <i>(feigns sadness)</i> That's unfortunate, I was <i>really</i> looking forward to meeting her.<br><br><i>(Location changes back to Zaofu as the metal petals surrounding the metal flowers bend close like a sealed flower bud. Cut to the dining room in Su's home. A burly man is the chef and explains the dishes.)</i><br><br><b>Chef:</b> Tonight, for your dining pleasure, I present a seared wild Kyoshi-Elephant koi <i>(Camera pans out to the table to show everyone has three dishes of food in front of them)</i> paired with a ginger infused pea tendril, and hibiscus root salad. <br><b>Su:</b> Stunning. <br><br><i>(The chef bows and walks away. Camera pans to right to show more of the table to reveal Lin is seated on Su's left. Cut to the room leading into the dining room as the chef leaves and bows to a man at the door.)</i><br><br><b>Baatar:</b> Sorry dear, I'm going to have to take dinner <i>(a younger man who looks just like him runs up with a stack of papers and pauses in front of the door)</i> in my office. I just had a major breakthrough on the tram station remodel.<br><br><i>(Cut to Su who loks at her husband fondly)</i><br><br><b>Su:</b> Well don't let me stand in the way of inspiration.<br><b>Baatar:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> You're the best!<br><b>Su:</b> <i>(turns to Korra who is seated to her right)</i> That was my brilliant architect of a husband, Baatar, and our oldest son. He engineers all my husband's projects. <br><b>Lin:</b> <i>(blandly)</i> Five kids, what a nightmare. <br><b>Su:</b> No no, my children are a blessing.<br><br><i>(Su takes a bite off her plate)</i> <br><br><b>Lin:</b> Yeah, Mom used to say that too but she never meant it.<br><br><i>(Su gives a glare. Camera angle changes to Opal and Bolin who starts to eat.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Mmm, <i>(points to the food with his chopsticks)</i> I have to admit, <i>(places the chopstick down on the table)</i> I was pretty skeptical when he said <i>pea</i> tendril. <i>(laughs)</i> But this is delicious! <br><b>Opal:</b> <i>(chuckles)</i> I know, right? <i>(places her own chopsticks down too)</i> I don't think I've ever had a bad meal in my life. <br><b>Bolin:</b> Oh, I had plenty when Mako and I were living on the streets. <i>(Opal turns towards Bolin, concerned)</i> I mean, you'll be surprised how bad food from a dumpster can be. <br><br><b>Opal:</b> I'm sorry, I didn't know. <br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(shakes his head)</i> No it's okay, it's okay, it's all in the past. Things are great now. <i>(counts with his fingers)</i> I got to be a pro-bender, fought against a dangerous revolution, become a mover star, and now I'm helping the Avatar rebuild a whole nation!<br><b>Opal:</b> Wow, your life sounds so exciting. <br><br><i>(Cut back to Su and Korra)</i><br><br><b>Su:</b> How's your search for the new airbenders going? <br><b>Korra:</b> Honestly, not great. We had to rescue a whole group of them from the Earth Queen. <br><b>Su:</b> <i>(frowns)</i> Oh, she's horrible! <i>(Cut to a close up of Su with Lin taking a sip from the glass in the background)</i> She thinks she can just do whatever she wants. <br><b>Lin:</b> Sounds familiar. <br><b>Su:</b> <i>(turns to Lin)</i> What? <br><br><i>(Lin puts down her cup)</i><br><br><b>Lin:</b> Nothing. <br><b>Su:</b> I mean the idea of even having a queen is so outdated, don't you agree Korra?<br><b>Korra:</b> I- I haven't really thought about it too much. <br><b>Su:</b> Well, you should start. The World is evolving and the Earth Queen can evolve with it. <i>(flings one arm out)</i> Step aside. <br><b>Lin:</b> <i>(forced enthusiasm)</i> Hey everyone, <i>(Su turns to Lin)</i> my little sister is an expert on World Affairs now. <br><b>Su:</b> You want to talk about what's really bugging you <i>(glares at Lin and has a hand on her waist)</i> because I'm right here!<br><br><i>(Lin returns the glare and is very tense. Her body is positioned to fight. Su relaxes in her seat.

I mean, what are any of us doing here? Wow. Food for thought. <i>(leans back in his chair back and places his feet on the table)</i> Anyhoo, how's our company doing? <br><b>Asami:</b> You mean <i>(places a hand on her collar)</i> <i>my</i> company? Future Industries reverted back to me <i>(glares at Varrick)</i> after <i>you</i> plotted to abduct the President.<br><b>Varrick:</b> <i>Allegedly</i> plotted to abduct the President. Never convicted.<br><b>Mako:</b> Err, that's because you escaped prison.<br><b>Varrick:</b> No, the universe decided to set me free. <i>(puts his feet back on the ground and the chair springs back to position to reveal Zhu-Li positioned behind him near the wall)</i> So, I looked up my old friend Su Yin here, pitched her a few ideas, and <i>(slams hand on table)</i> BAM! We're in business together!<br><b>Su:</b> Varrick's setting up my new technology division. <br><b>Varrick:</b> I've seen the future and the future is- <i>(brings out a classic U-shaped magnet)</i> Magnets! <i>(tosses it casually off-screen)</i> I'm working on a high speed rail that would revolutionize transportation and shipping as we know it! But that's not all, I'm-<br><b>Lin:</b> <i>(interrupts)</i> Alright, enough! <i>(Cut back to Lin, Su, and Korra as Lin stands up irritably)</i> I'm trying to keep the Avatar safe and you're harboring a criminal? <br><br><i>(Lin swipes her hand to the side.)</i><br><br><b>Su:</b> Ease up, Lin. Sure Varrick's made a few mistakes in his past but that doesn't mean he should pay for it the rest of his life. My chef was a pirate but now he's a culinary master. People change.<br><br><i>(Cut to Lin as she points an accusing finger at Su.)</i><br><br><b>Lin:</b> You haven't!<br><br><i>(Lin turns away and storms off. Cut to an aerial view of the room as Lin roughly shoves her chair, sending it flying backwards.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Lin!<br><br><i>(Cut to a back view of Lin's wire spools as she continues to walk out of the door. She lifts her arm and a cable shoots out from her armor which she aims behind to use the cable to close the door roughly. Cut to commercial break.)</i><br><br><br><br><b><u>Act III</u></b><br><br><i>(Episode returns to a hand dipping into a small jar of green gel. Running water can be heard in the background. Camera pans out to Mako and Bolin freshening up at the sinks. Bolin is brushing his teeth.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> So, you <i>(rubs gel in his hair)</i> and Opal seemed to hit it off at dinner. I think she's really into you.<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(his voice his muffled due to the toothpaste and toothbrush in his mouth)</i> Yeah you know, she's sweet and pretty and super nice. Too bad she's not my type. <br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(styles his hair)</i> Right, I forgot. Your type is dumb mover star or <i>(gels his eyebrows too)</i> psycho ice princess. <br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(spits into the sink)</i> You know, that hurts a little bit. <i>(places a hand on his heart)</i> Right here. <br><br><i>(Bolin turns and looks into the mirror. Then he gazes into his reflection and starts to touch his chin. Bolin gives a suave smile.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Maybe you're right, bro. <i>(licks his fingers and proceeds to use them to smooth out the little cowlick on his forehead)</i> Maybe Opal is Bolin material. Thanks. <i>(points to himself)</i> Yeah.<br><br><i>(Scene changes to a diorama of Zaofu. Korra steps into frame and looks at the models with interest.)</i><br><br><b>Su:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> You know, <i>(Korra turns to the side)</i> before I built this city there was nothing here. <i>(Camera pans out to an opulent green office with a high ceiling as Su walks in)</i> I wanted to make my mark on the World<br><b>Korra:</b><i>(gestures to the diorama)</i>  It's amazing. Thank you for being so welcoming. <i>(Su walks to a green sofa and takes a seat)</i> And I'm sorry for how Lin's been acting. <br><br><i>(Korra takes a seat on a similar sofa behind her)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Can I ask, what happened with you two?<br><b>Su:</b> <i>(crosses her legs over the knee and rests her head in her right hand)</i> It's complicated. We didn't have a normal childhood. Neither of us knew our fathers and Toph was always busy being Chief of Police. Because Mom grew up in such a strict house, she gave us all the freedom in the World hoping we figure out our own paths.<br><b>Korra:</b> That sounds like a good thing.<br><b>Su:</b> And in a way, it was. But we both ended up fighting for Mom's attention. Lin followed in her footsteps and became a cop. I was... <i>(gives a small smile)</i> more of a rebel. Mom wasn't too happy with how either of us turned out. When I was sixteen, I left home to explore the World. <i>(Cut to a shelf filled with trinkets. On one section, books, a primitive telescope, a black and white picture of a junk boat, a box of jewellery, and a monkey statue can be seen)</i> I sailed the seas on a pirate ship, <i>(Camera pans down to another section, revealing a toy Painted Lady statue, a blue and red mask, a black and white picture of a circus troupe, a camera, a pair of sandbender goggles, and more books)</i> joined a traveling circus for a while, and lived in a sandbender commune in the desert. <i>(Cut to a shot of Su's desk with a blue book and another book splayed open with blank pages. On the left, there is another black and white photo but this time, it shows Su, her husband, and their five children. On the right, there's a black and white photo of a baby.)</i> It took me a while but, I finally realized what I was looking for was a family. So I bought this plot of land, found a brilliant architect who later became my husband and created a place I could truly call home. <br><b>Korra:</b> It sounds like you created a perfect life here.<br><b>Su:</b> <i>(speaks sadly)</i> Almost. I always wanted Lin to be a part of it but I gave up hope long ago of her ever coming around.<br><br><i>(Korra glances to the side sadly too. <br><br>Scene changes to Opal practicing her airbending on a small pavilion. Cut to a frontal shot of Opal in her stance.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> Hey, <i>(Opal steps to the side to reveal Bolin standing at an archway behind her)</i> little lady. <i>(Bolin walks up to the pavilion and he attempts to flirt but he speaks in an off putting sultry voice.)</i> Wow, you really blowing me away with your airbending. Whoosh.<br><br><i>(Bolin starts to use his hands to fly and makes flying noises. Cut to Opal who isn't amused and she frowns.)</i><br><br><b>Opal:</b> Why are you acting weird?<br><b>Bolin:</b> Why are <i>you</i> acting weird?<br><b>Opal:</b> <i>(turns away from Bolin)</i>  I don't like how you're talking to me.<br><br><i>(The girl starts to walk off. Bolin is hurt and realizes his mistake.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b><i>(chases after her)</i>  Look, I'm sorry. I just get really self-conscious when I know a girl likes me and I end up acting stupid.<br><b>Opal:</b> <i>(still frowning)</i> Who said I liked you? <br><b>Bolin:</b> Oh no. But I thought... <i>(Opal begins to smile)</i> Mako said...<br><b>Opal:</b> Just kidding. But do me a favor and stop trying. <i>(Bolin slumps his posture)</i> Well, don't stop trying. Just stop trying so much, just be yourself.<br><b>Bolin:</b> Huh. Be myself. Yeah, I guess I could give that a shot.<br><br><i>(The young teens stare at each other quietly. Cut to a close up of their face very close to each other but in the background, we can see an outline of Korra.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Ahem. <br><b>Opal:</b> Oh. Hey, Korra. <br><b>Korra:</b> Can I steal you away from Bolin for a minute? I need your help with something.<br><br><i>(Opal waves a farewell to Bolin and he waves back.<br><br>Location changes to a scenic view of Air Temple Island at night. Cut to inside of Tenzin's study near a running fountain. The room is mostly shrouded in darkness except for the light streaming in from the doorway. Zaheer walks in quietly and heads towards the praying altar. He picks up a golden amulet. Camera cuts to a close up of the amulet with a carving of an airbender floating above the clouds. Zaheer opens the amulet to reveal an inscription in Chinese inside.)</i><br><br><b>Zaheer:</b> <i>(narrates inscription)</i> Let go your earthly tether, enter the void, empty, and become wind.<br><b>Ikki:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> What are you doing? <i>(Camera pans down to Ikki who is standing behind Zaheer)</i> No one's allowed in Daddy's study except Daddy. <br><br><i>(Steps towards Ikki)</i><br><br><b>Zaheer:</b> I'm sorry, I couldn't sleep.<br><b>Ikki:</b> What were you reading?<br><br><i>(Bends down to Ikki's level and shows her the amulet.)</i><br><br><b>Zaheer:</b> A poem by Guru Laghima. The wisest airbender who ever lived.<br><br><i>(Foot steps can be heard)</i><br><br><b>Kya:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> Ikki. <i>(Cut to Kya at the doorway)</i> You should be in bed. Come on.<br><b>Ikki:</b> <i>(waves goodbye to Zaheer)</i> Night.<br><b>Zaheer:</b> Good night.<br><br><i>(Kya waits for her niece to leave the room.)</i><br><br><b>Kya:</b> <i>(turns towards Zaheer and furrows her brows in suspicion)</i> You seem to know <i>a lot</i> about airbender history for someone who <i>just</i> got airbending. <br><b>Zaheer:</b> <i>(his facial expression is calm)</i> I've always admired the culture. <br><b>Kya:</b> And you moved through those gates like a natural. <i>(raises her brows)</i> Where did you say you were from?<br><b>Zaheer:</b> A small village up North. You probably never heard of it. <br><br><i>(Cut to a side view shot of the two as they stare at each other in silence. Tense music plays.)</i><br><br><b>Kya:</b> Wait. <i>(widens her eyes in fury)</i> Zaheer!<br><br><i>(Kya bends water from the fountain and sends ice chunks to Zaheer. He dodges them with airbending and grabs a hold of Tenzin's air glider staff from the altar. Zaheer breaks the window pane to escape. View changes to the outside as he runs along the roof top of the sheltered walkway below Tenzin's study. He opens up his glider and begins to fly. Kya jumps out of the window with both arms covered with water, similar to how Katara used to fight.)</i><br><br><b>Kya:</b> <i>(waterbends her "arm" towards Zaheer)</i> I need some help!<br><br><i>(She manages to grab a hold of Zaheer and the glider before jumping down into the pond below and slamming him into the water. She freezes Zaheer's foot but he jumps up, breaking the ice. Kya sends a stream of water at him but he swipes it aside with airbending. The waterbender is enraged and she uses the water to propel herself forward. When Kya lands close to Zaheer, she sends the water to the criminal but he jumps up before sending a blast of air in her direction, slamming her away. Kya rolls along the ground.<br><br>Zaheer runs towards his glider and attempts to pick it up but he is interrupted by a stream of fire hitting the ground beside the glider. He jumps backwards to avoid the flames.)</i><br><br><b>White Lotus guard:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i>Hold it right there!<br><br><i>(Cut to two White Lotus guards running up to the commotion and both firebend at Zaheer. Cut to Zaheer who rolls on the ground to avoid the attack. He successfully picks up his glider and swings it around, extinguishing the fire. Then he airbends the guards to the roof of the nearby walkway, knocking them unconscious and they drop into the pond. A wave of water moves up and slides off-screen. Camera cuts to Kya as the water swirls around her protectively. Cut to a close up of Kya as she silently regards Zaheer and plans her next attack. Then she shoots out a double spiralled water attack at Zaheer but he side steps it easily. He uses the glider and sends a gust of air to Kya, knocking her backwards again to the stone foundations of one of the buildings.)</i><br><br><b>Zaheer:</b> Sorry I wouldn't be joining you at the Northern Air Temple. I'm afraid I have other plans.<br><br><i>(He turns away and opens the glider, flying off to safety.<br><br>Scene changes to a corridor in Zaofu as guards patrol the area.

I heard so many great things about you from Mom and Grandma Toph.

The poor girl ignores Korra and runs out of the room.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> What's your problem? Don't get mad at Opal, <i>(frowns)</i> I asked her to talk to you because I thought it would help you snap out of whatever funk you're in. And I guess I was wrong. <br><b>Lin:</b> <i>(stands up and faces Korra)</i> Why don't you focus on fixing the World and <i>(raises her voice)</i> stop trying to fix my family! <br><b>Korra:</b> Su's right. You're never gonna change. <i>(Lin turns away from Korra)</i> You're always going to be a bitter, lonely woman. <br><br><i>(Cut to a back view of Lin as Korra turns and leaves the room, slamming the door shut off-screen.

After battling with Kya, he escaped and is now a wanted man in Republic City!          <br><br><br><br><b><u>Act I</u></b><br><br><i>(Episode opens up to a scenic view of Zaofu in the morning as a flock of doves fly past. The metal petals of each flower gradually open up, allowing sunlight into the city.

It was a busy few months.       <br><b>Su:</b> Well, it's probably for the best. <i>(gives a sly smile)</i> I'm sure Lin would be a horrible teacher. <i>(Su and Korra chuckle)</i> As the Avatar, <i>(Bolin is the only one at the table who keeps shoving food into his mouth)</i> you should have mastery over all the elements.

And your job.          <br><b>Lin:</b> I'm not interested in talking about my feelings.          <br><b>Aiwei:</b> You won't have to say a word. <i>(rustles with his robe and pulls out a green colored card)</i> I know a great acupuncturist in town <i>(angles the business card towards Lin)</i> who will be able to help you.          <br><br><i>(Lin takes the card and scrutinizes it.)</i><br><br><b>Lin:</b> Hmm.             <br><br><i>(Location changes to the Spirit Wilds in Republic City where vines have completely grown through an abandoned building. Various spirits swarm about. A police siren can be heard in the background. Cut to Zaheer and his gang resting in a dilapidated living room. Ming-Hua makes herself comfortable on a tree branch, Ghazan sits on the sofa, Zaheer is seated on the floor, and P'li is standing up with one foot on a small table.)</i><br><br><b>P'li:</b> Seems like you made quite a stir on Air Temple Island. The cops are swarming the city looking for us.<br><b>Ghazan:</b> You still want to try to take out the President?      <br><b>Zaheer:</b> No. He'll have to wait. We leave today.         <br><br><i>(Cut to an aerial view of an alley and camera focuses on a truck with its back doors open.

As he attempts to close the doors, a water arm sneaks out and yanks him away, slamming him against the side of the truck. He yelps with surprise and Ming-Hua angles him towards Zaheer and P'li. The waterbender changes one of the fingers in her water hand into a spike pointing at his throat.)</i>         <br><br><b>Delivery Man:</b> <i>(breaks out in cold sweat)</i> There's no money. I just made my last delivery.  <br><b>Ming-Hua:</b> We don't want money.     <br><br><i>(Cut to a tray of acupuncture needles on a table. All the needles move upwards and camera turns to Lin who has her torso armor off so she is now clad in a singlet. She watches as the needles hover above her.)</i><br><br><b>Lin:</b> How many of those things are you gonna stick in me?      <br><br><i>(Cut to an aerial view of the room.)</i><br><br><b>Acupuncturist:</b> I'll be placing several needles on each of your acupoints. <i>(Brings the needles above Lin's body)</i> There's nothing to be scared about.       <br><b>Lin:</b> <i>(raises her neck)</i> I'm not afraid of needles!  <br><b>Acupuncturist:</b> Please close your eyes and take a deep breath.     <br><br><i>(Lin lays her head back on the table. The needles are right above her now and she inhales and exhales. The needles descend down into various acupoints located on her wrist, palms, arms, and neck.)</i><br><br><b>Acupuncturist:</b> This process will correct the imbalances in your chi. Please tell me if you feel any pain or pressure.      <br><b>Lin:</b> I can't feel a thing.     <br><b>Acupuncturist:</b> That's unusual. <i>(places a hand on his chin)</i> Your chi must be powerfully blocked. We're going to need more needles. <i>(more needles descend on Lin's arm)</i> Acupuncture often taps into people's buried memories. <i>(the physician focuses on one single needle still in the air)</i> These memories can sometimes be difficult to process. <br><br><i>(He brings his hands down as the needle moves in the direction he indicates. Cut to Lin who looks smug.)</i><br>     <br><b>Lin:</b> Heh. Buried memories, uh-huh.    <br><br><i>(As the needle lands on the acupoint between her eyebrows, the camera zooms in and flashes white to three teenagers examining jewellery in a living room. We are in Lin's memory. The sound of a door opening is heard. The two teenaged boys put down their loot as footsteps walk into the room. Cut to a young Lin in her early twenties without any scars on her face. She is clad in a police uniform.)</i><br><br><b>Young Lin:</b> Su, what are you doing home?  <br><b>Young Su:</b> <i>(chuckles)</i> Wow.

Are you gonna tell Mom? <i>(one of the guys begins to push all the jewellery into a bag)</i> It's not like she's going to care.      <br><b>Young Lin:</b> Where'd you get all that stuff?         <br><b>Guy #1:</b> <i>(secures the bag with a clasp)</i> Uh, fell off the back of a truck.           <br><b>Young Lin:</b> What are you doing hanging out with these <i>losers</i>? <br><br><i>(All the young teens are visibly not pleased with Lin's statement.)</i><br><br><b>Young Su:</b> They're my friends,<i>(gets off from the sofa and stands up)</i>  and you have no right to call them that! <i>(She picks up the satchel and begins to walk out)</i> Come on, guys, let's get out of here.   <br><br><i>(Lin grabs her sister by the shoulder before she can step out of the door.)</i>  <br><br><b>Young Lin:</b> Su, stop!           <br><b>Young Su:</b> <i>(pushes Lin's arm away)</i> Get your hands off of me!   <br><b>Young Lin:</b> You have so much potential. You're ruining your life!       <br><b>Young Su:</b> At least I have a life.             <br><br><i>(Su closes the door and Lin stares angrily. We return back to the present with Lin still on the table but now she's perspiring and twitches occasionally.<br><br>Location changes to the courtyard outside as Su and Korra walk towards various meteorites perched on pedestals.)</i><br><br><b>Su:</b> These meteorites are perfect for beginning metalbenders. The metals have a unique property, <i>(Su bends a small portion of meteorite off the parent chunk)</i> making them easier to bend.   <br><br><i>(Su shapes the meteorite into a six-pointed star before changing its shape into a diamond.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> That's amazing!           <br><br><i>(Su bends the metal back into a lumpy, rectangular shape.)</i><br><br><b>Su:</b> Here, try it.    <br><br><i>(She bends the metal towards Korra who holds it in both hands.)</i>     <br><br><b>Korra:</b> Okay.             <br><br><i>(Holding the meteorite in her right hand, she lifts her left hand up and wiggles her fingers, moving it above the metal. Soft, calming music plays and we cut to a close of Korra who is concentrating intensely. A twig snaps and Korra looks off-screen. Camera zooms out to reveal Bolin and Pabu ducking behind a small meteorite wall.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Bolin, is that you?       <br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(Pabu squeaks and chirps)</i> No.             <br><b>Korra:</b> What are you doing?      <br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(walks out from behind his hiding spot)</i> Oh, hey, ladies. I was just, uh- I was just looking for Pabu. Pabu!              <br><b>Korra:</b> He's on your shoulder.    <br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(his eyes comically glance to right where Pabu is perched)</i> Oh, look, there you are. You know, I thought something was chewing on my ear. I'm probably gonna need to get a shot. Pabu has sort of a venom- a venom. <i>(walks toward the women)</i> Anyway, so what are you guys doing? You're metalbending over here or something?          <br><b>Su:</b> Want to give it a shot?       <br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(look to the side, a little downcast)</i> Nah, it's okay. I mean, only, like, one earthbender in a hundred can metalbend.         <br><b>Su:</b> Well, don't believe everything you hear. The only thing limiting you is your attitude.           <br><b>Bolin:</b> You know, well, maybe I'll just- I'll just stay and watch.       <br><br><i>(He moves his hands up and bends a little stool of earth behind him. Korra returns her attention back to the metal and moves her left hand over the meteorite again.)</i><br><br><b>Su:</b> Try to focus on the fine pieces of earth within the metal.    <br><br><i>(Korra heeds her words and concentrates. Cut to her fingers as the meteorite shivers and trembles in her palm. Finally, Korra metalbends a shape of a wave.)</i>       <br><br><b>Korra:</b> I can't believe it. I'm metalbending!           <br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(in awe)</i> Wow, you picked that up really, <i>(looks to the side)</i> really quick. I guess you're that one in a hundred.          <br><b>Su:</b> <i>(places a hand on Korra's shoulder)</i> Great job, Korra.       <br><br><i>(Scene changes back to Lin in the treatment room. Camera focuses on her face again before fading white to a memory of a radio on a moving Satomobile.)</i><br><br><b>Police Dispatcher:</b> <i>(over the comms)</i> Calling all units. Robbery reported on the corner of Fifth and Harbor.

A truck behind Lin brakes in time, narrowly avoiding a collision. The vehicle turns sharply into an alley. Cut to an aerial view of a street as the robbers' vehicle makes another turn to drive down the street. The police mobile is right on their tail. Lin swerves the car this way and that to avoid the pedestrians and the carts of goods. The innocent by-standers gasp and step aside to make way for the chase. Cut to Lin as she metalbends a cable to the runaway mobile's wheel, pulling it right off the axle.<br><br>The vehicle teeters dangerously on the road. Lin stops her car and gets out, running after the two suspects who are attempting to flee from their busted ride. Lin metalbends her cables out and grabs the two teenaged boys by their angles, making them trip and fall onto the screen. The wire spools on Lin's hips spark with friction.)</i><br><br><b>Young Su:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> Leave them alone!       <br><br><i>(Lin is surprised by the familiar sounding voice. Cut to the damaged Satomobile as Su clambers out of the driver's seat with sweat on her face. She looks at her sister uneasily. Cut to Lin with her eyes wide with shock.)</i><br><br><b>Young Lin:</b> Su?              <br><br><i>(Camera zooms in on young Lin's face and it flashes white. We are back to the present and Lin is visibly uncomfortable. She gasps and sits up, bending all the needles off her body. The needles fly around blindly in the room, breaking the mirrors, picture frames, and vases as they make contact. Cut to a profile shot of Lin who is drenched with sweat as she pants to catch her breath. She begins to slide off the table.)</i><br><br><b>Acupuncturist:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> Wait! <i>(he pops into frame and we can see three stray needles on his almost bald head)</i> Leaving in the middle of a session could make you sick.<br><br><i>(Cut to a frontal shot of Lin as she staggers towards the door.)</i><br><br><b>Lin:</b> I'm done here.<br><br><i>(She grabs the doorway and grunts before forcing herself to carry on walking.

The door behind him suddenly opens to reveal Lin. The Chief loses her balance and grabs another door beside her.)</i>         <br><br><b>Lin:</b> What did you do to me?     <br><b>Acupuncturist:</b> I tried to <i>warn</i> you. <i>(walks to Lin and begins to support her)</i> Come with me. <i>(aids Lin to the treatment table)</i> Let's go finish the session. <i>(Cut to an overhead shot of Lin as she lays on the table and grits her teeth)</i> Just relax and breathe.   <br><br><i>(The needle makes contact at the Yintang acupoint again. Camera flashes white to Lin's memory where a younger version of herself slams against the getaway vehicle, denting it.)</i>  <br><br><b>Young Lin:</b> So you're robbing stores with the Terra Triad now? <br><br><i>(Cut to a wide shot of the scene as the sisters confront each other in the middle of the road. Su's accomplices sit quietly at the side, watching the commotion.)</i>      <br><br><b>Young Su:</b> I didn't steal anything! I just drove the car. I owed my friends a favor, it's not a big deal.      <br><b>Young Lin:</b> I'm not letting you get away with this.       <br><b>Young Su:</b> <i>(laughs)</i> Oh.

Lin metalbends a cable from her hip and it catches Su's right wrist. The younger teen is enraged and she springs out a hidden knife from an arm gauntlet in her left hand, cutting the cable. The action slows down as the cable flies back to Lin and it makes contact with her with a loud smack and a bright flash. Lin is seen clutching the right side of her face and yells in pain. Cut to Su who stares dumbfounded at what she has done. Camera flashes back to Lin in the present with her eyes closed but she still twitches from the agonizing memory.<br><br>Location changes to a bridge in Republic City where the vehicles are held up by a police road block at the end on both sides of traffic. Cut to a police officer stepping up to the delivery man's truck and he visibly has cold sweat on his face.)</i>  <br><br><b>Police Officer:</b> Good afternoon. Where are you off to today?   <br><b>Delivery Man:</b> I, uh, got a delivery to make in Bao Yu. <i>(Cut to the inside of the truck as he reaches over to the passenger seat to grab a small set of documents.

Police sirens are heard and five police mobiles chase after them. P'li firebends with her mind, taking out two of the cop cars while the remaining three drive around the attack and continue the pursuit. P'li takes out one more vehicle while Ghazan bends a small portion of the bridge into lava. The last two cars drive into the lava and are trapped. Cut to Ming-Hua as she glances at the side mirror and then looks forward to continue driving.<br><br>Location changes to a meteorite perched on a pedestal in Zaofu. Whistling can be heard and Bolin comically stands up, continuing to casually whistle as he glances to the side to make sure no one sees him. He takes the meteorite in his hand and steps backwards. Then he puts one leg forward and begins to press against the rock really hard as he makes all sorts of groans and grunts, trying his very best to metalbend. He changes his position to the horse stance and repeats the procedure again to no avail.)</i>    <br><br><b>Opal:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> Hey, Bolin! <br><br><i>(Bolin is startled and looks to the side to reveal Opal standing a short distance away from him.)</i>         <br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Opal! <i>(hides the meteorite behind his back)</i> Oh, wow.

I wasn't really thinking about all my mustaches. I'm just- I'm just frustrated. I've been trying to metalbend, and I can't figure it out. Don't tell anyone, okay?    <br><b>Opal:</b> Why not?        <br><b>Bolin:</b> Because it's- it's embarrassing. This isn't the first time I've tried. I mean, I've been wanting to metalbend ever since I heard about Toph. <i>(Opal walks towards Bolin)</i> Your grandmother is my biggest hero.       <br><b>Opal:</b> <i>(lays a hand on Bolin's shoulder)</i> My Mom grew up learning from Toph. Just go train with her. Stop being so scared.      <br><b>Bolin:</b> You know what? Maybe I am scared, but what about you? <i>(Opal removes her hand)</i> I know that you want go to the Northern Air Temple to train with Tenzin, but you haven't done it because you're afraid too.      <br><b>Opal:</b> <i>(turns away from Bolin and looks out at Zaofu)</i> You know what?

He begins to metalbend all the needles off her body.)</i><br><br><b>Acupuncturist:</b> You're going to feel a bit fragile, <i>(sends the needles off-screen)</i> so it's probably best if you take it easy for a little while.<br><br><i>(Lin sits up.)</i><br><br><b>Lin:</b> I don't need to rest. I need to do something I should've done a long time ago. <br><br><i>(With perspiration still on her body, she begins to walk out of the room.<br><br>Scene changes to an aerial shot of the metalbending training courtyard.

She retired the next year. She was a hero.         <br><b>Lin:</b> <i>(incensed)</i> You think she <i>wanted</i> to retire? She was so guilt-ridden about what she did to protect you, she didn't feel worthy of her badge.  <br><b>Su:</b> Look, I admit that I was not a perfect kid and I've made some mistakes in the past, but-                <br><b>Lin:</b> You made some mistakes?     <br><b>Su:</b> Lin, Mom and I already talked about this years ago and worked things out. If you had gotten together with us like we'd asked, you would know that I'm a different person now. I've <i>been</i> a different person for a long time.        <br><b>Lin:</b> You think just because you live in a big, fancy house and have a chef who cooks you fancy food, that you're a different person? Maybe you can fool everyone else, but you can't fool me. I see right through you.    <br><b>Su:</b> You know what, Lin? You're the one who hasn't changed. You're still a bitter loner who only cares about herself. No wonder Tenzin ended things with you years ago.       <br><br><i>(Lin stomps her food and sends a chunk of earth at Su who lifts her hand up and it collides against her fist into small pieces.)</i><br><br><b>Su:</b> Okay, I guess this is how it's going to be.  <br><br><i>(Su earthbends a trail towards Lin, disrupting the metal plate Lin is standing on and causing the various meteorites to fall. Su also sends three meteorite chunks at her sister. Lin is thrown backwards and she does a roll before standing up and running towards Su. The Chief punches the ground to send a series of earth columns at her sister but Su lifts a metal plate up from the ground to shield herself. Su chucks the metal plate at Lin but the older woman jumps over it and lands on the ground. Lin proceeds to earthbend small pieces of earth up and sends it to Su who dodges from side to side.

Lin grabs the plate and tosses it behind her. The Chief proceeds to chuck more rocks at Su who continues to duck and weave around. Lin earthbends a sizeable chunk or earth and throws it at Su who metalbends the wall behind her around herself in a protective circle.

Thanks to the energy shift during Harmonic Convergence, certain people have acquired airbending abilities, including Bumi, Kai, and Opal. But although the new recruits show a lot of promise, they still have a lot to learn. So while Korra remains safe in Zaofu, Tenzin has brought the airbenders to the Northern Air Temple to begin their training.    <br><br><br><br><b><u>Act I</u></b><br><br><i>(Cut to a scenic view of a grass plain with hills and the Northern Air Temple in the background. Various colorful spirits mingle and fly about.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> His pupils once again pleaded with their master <i>(Camera cuts to a close up of the air temple)</i> to eat something, but he refused, <i>(Cut to Tenzin who tells the story excitedly)</i> just like he had each day the entire summer. <i>(Cut to the new airbenders as most of them are not paying attention except for two students)</i> Instead, he simply meditated, getting his nourishmen from the universe. So Monk Tang Xu completed the ninty-seventh day of his historic fast on which island?    <br><br><i>(A male airbender with glasses raises his hand.)</i>    <br><br><b>Otaku:</b> Ooh! Ooh, ooh!        <br><b>Tenzin:</b> Anyone besides Otaku, who already studied this in his acolyte training?    <br><b>Otaku:</b> Ooh, ooh, ooh!        <br><b>Tenzin:</b> And is answering every question?         <br><b>Otaku:</b> Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! <i>(Tenzin finally looks at Otaku for an answer)</i> Whaletail Island!           <br><b>Tenzin:</b> That is correct. Again. Now, on day ninty-eight-        <br><br><i>(The new airbenders begin to giggle and laugh. Tenzin is not amused. Cut to Bum-Ju stuffed in Bumi's air nomad outfit and the spirit's head "replaces" Bumi's.)</i><br><br><b>Bumi:</b> <i>(in a high pitched spirit-y voice)</i> Greetings, Air People. I come seeking boring stories to take back to the Spirit World. <br><br><i>(Bum-Ju squeaks and flies out of the shirt, causing Bumi to stumble for a bit. All the new airbenders laugh, including Jinora who stops laughing when Tenzin gives her a look. Jinora clears her throat.<br><br>Cut to the clouds in the sky as Tenzin rides Oogi through the clouds, performing a beautiful aerial display. He passes over his students' heads and they look up in awe. Tenzin lands Oogi near the students. Tenzin disembarks.)</i>      <br><br><b>Kai:</b> That was incredible! When do we get to fly around on our bison like that?     <br><b>Tenzin:</b> Only after <i>many</i> years of practice and intense training. <i>(the new airbenders start to groan off-screen)</i> Besides, <i>(touches his beard)</i> we don't have enough bison here for all of you.      <br><br><b>Kai:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> What about those? <i>(Tenzin raises his eyebrows with surprise)</i> It's a whole herd of bisons.  <br><br><i>(Cut to an overhead view of the students standing at the balcony as they view a herd of air bison flying by. Tenzin walks up to them.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Actually, the plural of "bison" is "bison."    <br><br><i>(Camera cuts to a close up of the group of adult bison.)</i> <br><br><b>Kai:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> Whoa!              <br><b>Daw:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> Cool!            <br><b>Yung:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> Wow, look at that. <br><br><i>(We return back to Kai and the others on the balcony)</i>     <br><br><b>Kai:</b> Can we ride those?  <br><b>Tenzin:</b> No, that's a wild herd. It would take many <i>years</i> to tame them. Now let's get back to our lessons.         <br><b>Meelo:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> Dad! <i>(Tenzin raises his head and camera pans up to reveal two sky bison with people on them flying towards the temple. Ikki waves excitedly to her father while Meelo points to the bison behind him.)</i> We brought you more airbenders!        <br><br><i>(The bison land in the courtyard and the airbenders walk up to meet the newcomers.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Okay, everyone is dismissed. We'll just... pick this up... <i>(sighs)</i> tomorrow. <br><br><i>(Camera changes angles to Pema who has disembarked and is carrying Rohan in a little baby seat on her back. Kya drops down from the saddle. Tenzin walks up to his wife and sister.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> How was everything in the city?          <br><b>Pema:</b> Well, we had a little scare, but everything is okay. Zaheer infiltrated the Air Temple.         <br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(shocked)</i> What? Is everyone all right?     <br><b>Kya:</b> Everyone's fine. <i>(gestures to herself)</i> I fought with him, but he got away. And he stole some old necklace that had something to do with Guru <i>(pauses)</i> Lak... <i>(hesitates for a moment but says it anyway)</i> schmeer.    <br><b>Tenzin:</b> Guru Laghima.    <br><b>Kya:</b> <i>(humors her brother)</i> Right. You know, I can never keep all those gurus straight. There were, like, a million of them. Remember that long, boring story about the guy who never ate?         <br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(unamused)</i> Yes, I remember.  <br><br><i>(An Air Acolyte appears in the background behind Tenzin.)</i>        <br><br><b>Air Acolyte:</b> Avatar Korra is calling on the temple radio.   <br><br><i>(Cut to the radio buzzing with static as a hand reaches in to pick up the microphone speaker.)</i>   <br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Are you all right? Where are you?         <br><br><i>(View changes to Korra on the radio and the brothers Mako and Bolin are hanging around close to her.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> With Bei Fong's sister in Zaofu. <i>(smiles)</i> We're totally safe, <i>(frowns a bit)</i> unless we get caught in another fight <i>(Bolin smiles)</i> between Su and Lin.       <br><br><i>(A frame of Tenzin slides in and he now occupies half the screen on the right while Korra occupies the half the screen on the left.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Lin willingly took you to her sister?         <br><b>Korra:</b> Not exactly. We got a call about a new airbender, and it turned out to be Su's daughter, Opal. She'll be headed your way soon.         <br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(pleasantly surprised)</i> Really? That's wonderful!     <br><br><i>(Bolin, who is seated beside Korra leans in suddenly and Korra is nudged aside. The earthbender begins to gush about Opal over the radio.)</i>      <br><br><b>Bolin:</b> She <i>is</i> wonderful <i>(He grabs the microphone and blushes like a love bird. Korra and Tenzin give weirded out faces.)</i> and pretty and so smart! <i>(Korra changes her facial expression to annoyance at Bolin for hogging the radio)</i> And she smells like flowers. <i>(he pauses and looks at Korra before putting the microphone back on the table)</i> Sorry. Bolin out. <br><br><i>(Bolin slides off-screen and Korra resumes speaking to her mentor.)</i>             <br><br><b>Korra:</b> How's the training going?   <br><b>Tenzin:</b> Not so well, I'm afraid. No one seems to be interested in the <i>hard work</i> required to become a part of the Air Nation.          <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(Cut to a close up of Korra now as she occupies the whole frame)</i> You need to give yourself a break. Let Jinora and the kids help you out. And what about Bumi? He was a naval commander. Maybe he has some ideas about how to get people motivated.     <br><br><i>(View changes to Tenzin in the air temple)</i>         <br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(raises his eyebrows with slight irritation)</i> Bumi? He's my worst student!     <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(off-screen, over the radio)</i> Yeah, but he loves to organize people. If you ask him for help, you can trick him into taking more responsibility by making him think the whole thing was his idea.  <br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(relaxes his facial expression)</i> Hmm. That actually sounds like a good plan. <i>(smiles fondly)</i> You're turning into a pretty wise Avatar after all. <br><br><i>(We cut back to Korra who is also smiling.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Conflict resolution. It's what I do.   <br><br><i>(Scene changes to Kai and Jinora seated on the balcony ledge looking down at the sky bison herd.)</i>      <br><br><b>Kai:</b> We should go down there. I want to fly one of those bisons.      <br><b>Jinora:</b> I don't know. We might get in trouble.    <br><b>Kai:</b> Come on, let's have some fun. We'll be back before anyone realizes we're gone.      <br><b>Jinora:</b> <i>(smiles a little)</i> I guess it will be all right.    <br><br><i>(Both children pick up their own air gliders to open them up before dropping down and flying themselves on the gliders. A group of spirits on the ground look up at the sight. A little bird-like spirit squeaks and flies in front of Jinora along with other kinds of flying spirits. Jinora gives a smile at the bird-like creature. Cut to an aerial view of the pair flying over a little mountain ridge as they catch sight of bison below near a watering hole.)</i>  <br>        <br><b>Kai:</b> Look, baby bisons. <i>(Cut to a close up of three very cute baby bison as one grooms itself and the other two play fight with each other)</i> How come they're all on the ground?         <br><b>Jinora:</b> <i>(View changes to a frontal shot of the duo)</i> Air bison calves can't fly for a week or two after they're born, so the entire herd will stay near the ground in the valley.      <br><br><i>(Kai angles his glider downwards and flies off-screen)</i>   <br><br><b>Kai:</b> Let's go see the babies.      <br><b>Jinora:</b> Be careful. The mothers are <i>very</i> protective.<br><br><i>(Cut to the ground as Kai lands in front of the babies and closes his glider. The calves make little coos and grunts. All three look up at him with curiosity. One walks towards Kai and he lays a hand on its head, stroking it affectionately.)</i><br><br><b>Kai:</b> Aw, look how cute.    <br><br><i>(The calf licks Kai's face)</i>  <br><br><b>Jinora:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> Kai, get out of there!  <br><br><i>(Cut to an overhead view of Jinora still on her glider but we can see that down below, a mother bison is a short distance away from her babies and Kai. Cut to Kai who turns around to face the mother which growls at him. She stomps her foot a few times and growls menacingly. Kai drops his glider staff in fear. The mother then charges at the boy but Kai remains rooted to the spot. Cut to a side view shot as Jinora flies in and wraps her legs around Kai's torso, lifting him out of harm's way.)</i>  <br><br><b>Kai:</b> Whoa! <br><br><i>(The babies huddle together from the commotion as their mother lands beside them. View changes to a foot on the ground. Camera zooms out to Kai standing while Jinora closes her glider and lands beside Kai. They have taken refuge at a small rocky column.)</i><br><br><b>Kai:</b> Wow, you really saved me down there.   <br><br><i>(Jinora drops to the ground and sighs with relief)</i>          <br>           <br><b>Kai:</b> You know, you're an incredible airbender.    <br><b>Jinora:</b> Well, I've been training for a long time.        <br><b>Kai:</b> Then why don't you have tattoos like an airbending master?      <br><b>Jinora:</b> <i>(looks away, downcast)</i> My Dad says I'm not a master yet.      <br><b>Kai:</b> <i>(sits down on the grass)</i> You can do everything your Dad can, <i>(Jinora looks at Kai, wide-eyed)</i> plus you have all those spirit-y powers. If anyone's a master, you are.<br><br><i>(The girl blushes. View changes to an aerial view of the courtyards outside the air temple.)</i> <br>         <br><b>Bumi:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> So we bring the net down on <i>(Cut to Bumi regaling his tale to three airbenders. He has removed his Air Nomad top and is now wearing just a singlet.)</i> the head pirate, and he looks around real sad and says, <i>(does his best impression of a pirate)</i> "I knew I should have followed my dreams and become a dentist."     <br><b>Yung:</b> <i>(chuckles)</i> How come you grew up to be so <i>cool</i>, while Tenzin became such a stick in the mud?    <br><b>Bumi:</b> Well, I guess "cool" is just something you're born with.<br><br><i>(Walks out from a small passage way leading to the courtyard.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Bumi, can I talk to you?    <br><br><i>(The airbenders who were listening to Bumi's story disperse.)</i>  <br><br><b>Bumi:</b> Let me guess. You want to criticize me for something. <br><b>Tenzin:</b> Actually, I need your help.  <br><b>Bumi:</b> <i>(begins to dig his ear with his pinky)</i> Oh, yeah? With what?              <br><b>Tenzin:</b> I don't think I'm doing very well with the new airbenders, and everyone knows you're a natural leader. <i>(smiles awkwardly at his brother)</i>   <br><b>Bumi:</b> <i>(removes his pinky from his ear with a pop)</i> True, I did win the Admiral Tung Natural Leadership Award. Twice.             <br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(looks a bit skeptical but forces a pleasant smile)</i> What would you do if you were in charge? Help me be more like you.       <br><b>Bumi:</b> I'd <i>love</i> to. <i>(Bumi stands up and then stands at attention)</i> You've gotta use military discipline to whip these troops into shape. The only way to deal with new recruits is to <i>(punches a hand forward)</i> break them down, so you can <i>(brings both hands up)</i> build them back up. Rule with an iron fist! <i>(clenches his hand into a fist)</i> Show them who the master is. <i>(waves his fist very close to Tenzin's face)</i><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Thanks for the insight. <i>(smiles at Bumi)</i>       <br><b>Bumi:</b> <i>(returns the smile)</i> My pleasure.    <br><br><i>(View changes to a scenic shot of the air temple in the morning and the sun has barely risen. Cut to the inside of a room facing a door and it bursts open to reveal Tenzin. He lifts a horn up, takes a deep breath, and blows into the instrument, sending sound waves and air throughout the dormitory. Cut to Yung and Bumi as they suddenly sit up. Yung rubs his eyes sleepily.)</i>     <br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Dawn patrol! Everyone up!          <br><b>Bumi:</b> <i>(stands up and yawns)</i> What are you doing? <i>(rubs the back of his head)</i> It's barely light out.     <br><br><i>(View switches to Tenzin who stands at attention with the horn behind his back.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> I'm taking your advice.

We can see airbenders hopping up the cliff face with their bending. Cut to the top of the cliff as Tenzin and Jinora land on it smoothly and cushioning their feet with airbending. Kai leaps up but falls flat on his face. Two other airbenders climb up and struggle.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Nothing like a ten mile hike first thing in the morning.   <br><b>Yung:</b> <i>(shivers)</i> Don't these robes come in a warm, bison fur version?  <br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> No, of course not!  <br><br><i>(Yung scowls and Bumi stands up.)</i>    <br><br><b>Bumi:</b> Oh! <i>(falls back down to the ground, exhausted)</i>  If it weren't so cold, <i>(another airbender collapses behind him)</i> I'd go right back to sleep.   <br><b>Tenzin:</b> Then this is the perfect time to learn meditation and proper breathing technique. <i>(walks away)</i> Airbenders are able to warm themselves with only their breathing. <i>(sits down in the lotus position)</i> Everyone get into the lotus position. Ah, <i>(Bumi crawls towards his brother)</i> this is so much more refreshing than sleeping.       <br><b>Bumi:</b> <i>(whispers)</i> You know, when I said that thing about an iron fist-<br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(interrupts)</i> Hush. Meditation time. Focus.       <br><br><i>(Bumi looks sad and he crawls to a spot behind Tenzin before getting into position. Peaceful, serene music plays and we cut to a view behind Tenzin.

You guys should totally get shaved.   <br><br><i>(Bumi walks towards his brother)</i>        <br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> I'm proud of you. Your connection with the spirits and natural leadership... You remind me of Dad.      <br><b>Bumi:</b> <i>(remorseful)</i> I'm sorry I've been causing you so much trouble. I guess I was just scared of not being able to measure up as an airbender. You know, even though I'm Aang's son, I never really felt like I was part of the Air Nation before. <br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(places a hand on Bumi's shoulder and smiles)</i> You are now.         <br><br><i>(Wistful music plays and we cut to a shot of Tenzin's three older children and Kai playing with the calves.

After training with Su Bei Fong, Korra quickly picked up the new skill and Bolin is hoping to follow in her footsteps. Meanwhile, the airbender Zaheer is closing in on Zaofu. By his side, are the lavabender Ghazan, the waterbender Ming-Hua, and the combustion bender P'li. But what do these mysterious criminals want with the Avatar? <br><br><br><br><b><u>Act I</u></b><br><br><i>(Episode opens up to the city of Zaofu in the day. Cut to a close up of Korra's eyes and the view switches to her hip where the metal cable holders are clipped on. She is in a stand off against Wing who smirks. Wing moves the meteorite behind him and divides it into two, sending them towards Korra. The Avatar metalbends the two chunks of rock away and unleashes a cable from her hip towards Wing who ducks. Korra whips the cables around against him and he manages to step on it, before metalbending it up in a loop and sending it back towards Korra. The cable entraps her and Korra falls to ground, tied up. She looks at Wing annoyingly.)</i><br><br><b>Wing:</b> <i>(fist pumps)</i> I can't believe I'm sparring with the Avatar!       <br><br><i>(Camera pans down to his twin brother.)</i><br><br><b>Wei:</b> <i>(bored and frowning)</i>  I can't believe I'm stuck with her friend.    <br><br><i>(Camera angle changes to an aerial view of the practice area and Wing earthbends a trail towards Korra who jumps and dodges. We can see Bolin standing in front of Wei.)</i>    <br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Hang on, <i>(holds a meteorite in his hands)</i> I think I got it. Let me just try this.   <br><br><i>(He groans and presses the rock as hard as he can but it falls out of his palms.)</i>   <br><br><b>Bolin:</b> No? Okay, maybe if I- <i>(two metal plates bend up and smack him on either side)</i> ow!      <br><br><i>(Cut to Wei with his arms raised in a bending position. In the background, Mako and Asami walk towards them.)</i> <br><br><b>Wei:</b> Trial by fire! It's the best way to learn metalbending.     <br><br><i>(Wei bends another meteorite at Bolin and he gives a yelp before ducking. The earthbender sweeps one foot up, bending a small piece of rock from the ground and he sends it towards Wei. The rock smacks against Wei's forehead and he grunts, dropping the meteorite.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Oh, nice shot, Bolin. <i>(Wei grabs his face with both hands and makes little moans of pain)</i> But I thought you were supposed to be practicing metalbending, not <i>earth</i>bending.          <br><b>Wei:</b> <i>(rubs his red forehead)</i> Yeah, cheater. <i>(crosses his arms)</i>       <br><b>Bolin:</b> Mako, metalbending is extremely difficult. No one gets it right away, if they can get it at all! It's not normal!        <br><br><i>(He looks to the side and view changes to Korra with hands tied up against her waist by the cables. She spins around and kicks away a meteorite aimed at her. Korra kneels down and Wing enters the screen with a meteorite in hand but the Avatar whips a cable at him, knocking the boy off balance. The cables loosen and completely retract into the holder once Korra is done.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(jumps)</i> Whoo-hoo! <i>(flexes her biceps)</i> Metalbending champion!     <br><b>Bolin:</b> Oh, sure. She's the <i>Avatar</i>.           <br><b>Asami:</b> Guys, it's time to get cleaned up. Tonight's Opal's farewell dinner.     <br><b>Bolin:</b> Aw, now I gotta say bye to Opal? This is the worst day ever!  <i>(walks away sulking)</i><br><br><i>(Scene changes to the dining room where Opal is seated with her parents in the middle section of the table. The chef walks in with plates of food in hand and lays a dish of vegetable wraps in front of Opal.)</i><br><br><b>Opal:</b> Thanks for making my favorite meal.           <br><b>Chef:</b> I'm really going to miss you, Opal. No one appreciates my raw veggie wraps like you do. <i>(walks away to serve the remaining plates of food)</i><br><b>Bolin:</b> Every time I eat raw kale, I'm gonna think of you.     <br><b>Opal:</b> You're so sweet.          <br><b>Bolin:</b> This stinks. We were just starting to get to know each other and now you're off  to the Northern Air Temple.   <br><b>Opal:</b> We'll be together soon. You guys are heading up after finding more airbenders, right? <br><b>Bolin:</b> Yeah, but that's... in the future. Oh, I hate the future.     <br><b>Opal:</b> Until then, <i>(grabs one veggie wrap and extends it towards Bolin)</i> we'll always have kale.     <br><br><i>(Bolin munches on the pre-offered food and Opal looks at him with a wistful smile.

The indicator doesn't move at all.)</i>         <br><br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(Korra looks confused)</i> Uh... <i>(camera pans out to the trio)</i> I think <i>(hands the gadget back to Varrick)</i> it's broken.      <br><b>Varrick:</b> It's not broken. She needs to <i>(waves his hands around in a bending motion)</i> airbend into it! <i>(grabs the airbender finder)</i> How else do you expect the thing to work?!    <br><br><i>(Varrick doesn't look pleased and we cut to the other side of the dining table where Mako strains to hear the conversation.)</i>     <br><br><b>Mako:</b> What's going on? I can't hear anything, I hate sitting down here. <i>(He grabs his glass and camera pans down to reveal Aiwei watching his outburst. Mako looks to the Truth Seer awkwardly.)</i> Not because of you.       <br><b>Aiwei:</b> <i>(dryly)</i> I can tell you're lying.  <br><br><i>(Mako slumps in his chair and drinks from the cup. A metallic object tapping against the glass three times is heard. Camera pans back to the middle of the table again and Su has stood up with a glass raised.)</i>    <br><br><b>Su:</b> Everyone, if I could have your attention, please. Tonight, my beautiful little girl leaves for the Northern Air Temple. <i>(places a hand on her necklace)</i> Opal, none of us could be more proud of you. You're an incredible daughter, sister, friend, <i>(lays a hand on her daughter's shoulder)</i> and soon-to-be <i>(Su bends down a bit and Opal rests against her mother's shoulder)</i> airbending master. <br><br><i>(Su gives a kiss on Opal's head. Cut to Huan, Wing, and Wei who watch the slightly emotional scene. The twins sniffle and Huan rolls his eyes.)</i><br><br><b>Su:</b> <i>(raises her glass up high)</i> Here's to Opal. May she help lead us into the new era.     <br><br><i>(Everyone raises their glasses. Scene fades to the docking bay at sunset and an airship takes off. Cut to Opal standing at the window of the ship and waving goodbye to her family and friends. Camera angle changes to an aerial view of the docking bay where we can see a small crowd looking up at the airship and some are waving to Opal. Cut to a female guard, Kuvira, behind the group as she pulls out a radio from a metal bag near her hip.)</i>      <br><br><b>Kuvira:</b> Lock it down for the night.  <br><br><i>(Cut to Korra, Lin, and Bolin. The latter stops waving and looks a little sad.)</i><br><br><b>Lin:</b> <i>(gives Korra a smile)</i> We'll head out first thing in the morning.    <br><br><i>(Bolin sighs solemnly and Korra rests a hand on his back.

Cut to an aerial view of the surrounding parks and the guests houses as various guards walk up and down the perimeter. Below, we can see a small group running across a trail in the park towards a bridge. Cut to Zaheer and his gang quietly peering out from under the bridge. In the background, a guard has a metallic staff in hand and he looks down at the bridge for a few seconds before walking off. Zaheer waves his hand and signals to everyone to continue moving forward. <br><br>Cut to another guard patrolling the sheltered walkway as the bad guys use the cover of darkness to sneak past the walkway undetected. They head towards a guest house in the far end. View changes to a snoring Bolin in his pajamas with a blanket over him. Pabu is curled up on top of the blanket and the fire ferret perks up with a squeak.)</i>     <br><br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(snores)</i> Kale, kale, kale.           <br><br><i>(Pabu leaps off the bed to the nearby window ledge and sees the four bad guys outside the window. Pabu paws against the glass and starts to shriek, jolting Bolin awake.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> What? <i>(his pet continues to shrill)</i> What's going on? <i>(lays down on the pillow with annoyance)</i> Pabu, sleep!     <br><br><i>(Cut to P'li and Ghazan ducking down an alley between two guest houses while Zaheer and Ming-Hua hide under a window. Ming-Hua raises a water tentacle up and forms a small sickle at the end. She uses the ice sickle to scratch the glass in a circle. Cut to the inside of the room that Ming-Hua is attempting to break into and we see Naga sleeping in front of the bed. Camera pans right to Korra in her pajamas, deeply asleep.<br><br>Camera returns back to the sickle on the window as it makes a complete circle. Water encases the cut glass and it pulls away quietly off-screen. Then another water tentacle arm holding three red darts is raised. Cut to Naga whose ears flap a bit and she wakes up with a growl. The polar bear-dog stands up and snarls but three darts fly past and embeds itself in Naga's shoulder. The beast whines and falls to the floor. Camera pans up to Korra sitting up on the bed.<br><br>Cut to Zaheer at the hole in the window where he airbends another dart into the room. View changes to Korra who leaps up with fire in her hand but the dart makes contact with her thigh. She grunts and falls to the ground in a sitting position. Cut to a close up of Korra as she groans. She raises an arm up shakily before collapsing on Naga. A door opens and we cut to Korra's point of view where her vision is blurry and she sees Ghazan and P'li looming over her.<br><br>Scene changes to Pabu at the window and he jumps onto Bolin's bed, waking the earthbender.)</i>     <br><br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(startled)</i> What? <i>(Pabu is on his chest and keeps squeaking)</i> Huh? What? Pabu. <i>(the fire ferret jumps to the window and Bolin turns his head towards his pet)</i> It's not play time right now. Okay, <i>(Cut to a close up of Pabu and we can see Zaheer and his gang running past with Korra on Ghazan's shoulder)</i> we are seriously going to have to have a talk- <i>(Cut to Bolin who widens his eyes with surprise)</i> What the heck! <i>(Mako stirs and camera cuts to Korra laying limp in Ghazan's hold.)</i> They got Korra! <i>(View changes back to Bolin and Mako sits up in his bed)</i> They've got Korra!   <br><br><i>(Bolin yells at his brother and the firebender tosses the blanket aside, opening the door and his brother follows shortly after. Cut to the doors of the brothers' guest house as it opens to reveal Mako and he punches fire at the criminals.)</i>       <br><br><b>Mako:</b> Let her go!          <br><br><i>(Bolin stomps on the ground, bending up a sizeable boulder towards Zaheer and his gang. Cut to the bad guys as P'li intercepts the fire with her hands and bends it away. Ming-Hua jumps up and slices the boulder in half with her water tentacles. She stretches out a water arm towards the brothers. Cut to Mako and Bolin as the former kicks out a flame to evaporate Ming-Hua's water. View changes to P'li, Zaheer, and Ghazan unleashing a three elemental attack. We cut back to Bolin who bends up a small wall of earth and a boulder collides against it, making it crumble. Bolin pulls his brother towards the pillars in the nearby walkway as they dodge the fire and air blasts. Another rock flies into screen.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(peers from behind the pillar)</i> They've got Korra!          <br><br><i>(Cut to a guard shining a spotlight on the criminals and an wailing alarm sounds throughout the city. Camera cuts onto another guard who also shines a search light. Cut to an aerial view of the park as the two lights move and converge onto one single point. View changes to Zaheer and his friends as they get illuminated by the lights.)</i><br><br><b>Ming-Hua:</b> So much for the element of surprise.  <br><b>Ghazan:</b> Back up plan.         <br><br><i>(P'li inhales and firebends with her mind. The attack takes out one spotlight. She combustion bends again to destroy the remaining search light and it is dark once more. P'li turns to the side and bends one last time and her attack curves in the air, around the corner towards Mako and Bolin. Cut to the brothers as the attack hits the pillar with a fiery explosion, knocking them backwards. Cut to Asami opening the door to her guest house as the siblings tumble to a stop in front of her. Mako lands on top of his brother and Asami runs forward, kneeling down, and resting a hand on the firebender's shoulder.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(struggles to sit up)</i> We <i>can't</i> let them take her.  <br><b>Asami:</b> I don't think they're going to get far. Look.   <br><br><i>(The trio turn their attention off-screen and we see that Zaheer and his team have made it to the middle of the courtyard. Two Zaofu guards flank them but they get taken out by firebending and airbending. The villains run forward but are stopped by three metal plates that suddenly stand upwards. Cut to Lin as she makes a few bending movements. View changes to the criminals as they get enclosed by the plates. Cut to Su and her twin sons as they bend too. Camera angle changes to an aerial view of the confrontation and Zaheer and company are boxed in by the metal plates.)</i>           <br><br><b>Kuvira:</b> <i>(steps forward and stands in a defensive posture alongside her colleague)</i> We have you surrounded, it's over. Release the Avatar!<br>     <br><i>(Tense, exciting music plays and the pro-bending brothers along with Asami run up near the guards. Cut to the grass beneath the metal plates as the ground gradually turns red hot and into lava. Lin bends up a mound of earth and jumps back to safety. Kuvira and her companion shoot out metal cables to propel themselves backwards, away from the lava. Cut to Lin as she lands near the three teens. Switch to an aerial view of the stand off as the metal plates slowly give way from the heat. Cut to Zaheer and his team in defensive poses behind the metal shielding. We return back to Lin and the youths.)</i>  <br><br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(awestruck)</i> No way! <i>(gestures his hands out)</i> That guy's lavabending, that's awesome...-ly <i>(raises his eyes up nervously)</i> not good for us.   <br><br><i>(View changes to the villains on their protective island with a lava moat around them. Cut to commercial break.)</i>     <br><br><br><br><b><u>Act II</u></b><br><br><i>(Episode returns to an aerial view of the lava moat with Lin and company ducking behind a metal plate to avoid P'li's attack. Cut to Korra with her eyes open on the ground but she's still quite drowsy. We change to her slightly hazy point of view as she looks at her captors.)</i><br><br><b>Zaheer:</b> I'm going to create some cover. We're getting out of here.  <br><br><i>(Zaheer twirls his glider staff rapidly, gathering as much smoke as he can from the hot lava. A Zaofu guard shoots out a cable and binds both of Zaheer's wrists, pulling him across the moat and back onto land. Ghazan tries to intercept by shooting a molten rock but another guard shifts the metal plate just in time, saving his colleague.<br><br>As Zaheer lands on the ground, he does a quick spin and frees himself from the cables. Noticing another guard behind him, he airbends her against a nearby pillar. The guard who managed to grab Zaheer earthbends a slab and sends it flying to the airbender. Zaheer turns around just in time to smack away the rock with his glider.<br><br>Cut to Lin standing up from behind the metal shield as she bends a chunk of earth towards the centre of the moat. She goes back into cover and the brothers stand up to shoot their attacks. Bolin ducks but Mako fires one last blast. Cut to P'li who is looking away from the teen but Ming-Hua steps in front of her and extinguishes Mako's flame. P'li combustion bends and once again, the attack moves in a curve towards the group hiding behind the metal plate. Another metal plate slides up just in time to cover the side, protecting Lin and the youths. View changes to Su and her youngest sons in bending stances, showing that they bended the plate. All three run forward to seek cover from behind the two plates.)</i>    <br><br><b>Lin:</b> How did they get in here?   <br><br><i>(Another explosion occurs and all of them grimace.)</i><br><br><b>Su:</b> I don't know, but we're not letting them escape.    <br><br><i>(View changes to two guards rapidly firing dirt at the villains but Ghazan manages to knock them away. Cut to another side of the moat where a team of guards have metalbended the plates into a temporary bridge to cross the lava moat. Two guards run across the bridge and we cut to the middle of the island where Ghazan has noticed the intruders. He brings his arms out and a stream of lava shoots upwards, destroying the metal bridge.)</i><br><br><b>Guards:</b> <i>(surprised)</i> Whoa! <br><br><i>(The two guards are tossed in the air briefly before slamming hard on the ground at their colleagues' feet. Cut to Asami peering over the metal shielding.)</i>            <br><br><b>Asami:</b> There's no way to cross that moat.   <br><br><i>(Camera pans to Su who looks up at the closed dome.)</i>    <br><br><b>Su:</b> We don't need to cross it. Lin and I can drop in from the dome on cables.    <br><b>Lin:</b> That's a great idea. Except we'll get blown up the second that third-eyed freak sees us.   <br><br><i>(P'li can be heard combustion bending and another explosion is fired, making everyone flinch.)</i>      <br><br><b>Su:</b> She's a combustion bender. If one of you can stun her, her powers will be knocked out temporarily.    <br><b>Mako:</b> Bolin can land a shot.    <br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(disbelief)</i> I can?            <br><b>Su:</b> You have to take her out right before we drop down.      <br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(a little confused)</i> I do?           <br><br><i>(Scene changes to the plains outside Zaofu and the camera focuses on a closed up metal petal city. Cut to the roof top where Lin and Su have tied cables around their torsos which are attached to a big reel and two security personnel stand guard over them. Cut to a frontal shot of Wing and Wei in front of their mother and aunt. Wing pulls out a radio from the radio case strapped across his body.)</i>  <br><br><b>Wing:</b> Open the hatch.  <br><br><i>(Cut to an overhead view of the hatch as it drops down a few feet into the roof before sliding open, giving them a perfect view of the lava moat. Su wraps the excess cable around her hand and walk towards the open hatch with her sister.)</i>   <br>      <br><b>Su:</b> <i>(to Wei)</i> If we get in trouble, metalbend us up.        <br><b>Wing:</b> We're in position.      <br><br><i>(Cut to Mako on the ground talking into the radio device.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Copy that. It's Bolin time.  <br><br><i>(Another explosion occurs and they wince again.)</i>      <br><br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(motivates himself)</i> All right. Bolin time. Bolin time!   <br><br><i>(Cut to the other side of the shield as Bolin stands up to bend a small rock at the criminals. Camera pans backwards to the little island as P'li ducks and combustion bends. She dodges again as another rock flies by. Cut to a frontal shot of P'li with both of her hands raised and a water tentacle comes into frame, catching a third rock and swinging it away. <br><br>Ming-Hua sends out some water and Ghazan backs her up by shooting out some lava. Mako bends a huge stream of fire to intercept the lava and it gets pushed away. Cut to a close up of the brothers as they continue to bend. Ming-Hua's water attack collides against the outside of the metal shield harmlessly.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(grabs his head)</i> I can't get a clean shot!    <br><br><i>(The brothers duck just in time as lava collides against the metal plate, spilling a little over the shielding, and a stream of water flies over Bolin's head.)</i>   <br><br><b>Mako:</b> You have to!        <br><b>Wei:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> Are we a go?  <br><br><i>(Camera pans out to the radio on the ground as Mako picks up the receiver.)</i>    <br>   <br><b>Mako:</b> No go.<br><br><i>(Another attack of lava collides against the shield.)</i>            <br><br><b>Wing:</b> Copy that. We're a go.<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(yells into the speaker)</i> I said no! Wait!   <br><br><i>(Cut to roof as the twins give each other a thumbs up. Su and Lin jump down the hatch. Cut to Mako and Bolin as they peer over the shield towards the island. Frame rate slows down as we cut to P'li who returns her attention to the brothers but then looks up suddenly. Frame rate returns to normal and camera cuts to the Bei Fong sisters plunging downwards into battle. View returns back to the teens.)</i>       <br><br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(stands up and punches fire)</i> Bolin, take the shot!   <br><br><i>(Cut to P'li as she gets into a stance. Camera cuts back to Bolin as he steels himself and stands up to earthbend a small piece of earth. The camera follows the rock as it sails across the moat and successfully makes contact with P'li tattoo, stunning her. A blast of combustion bending happens over the little island, knocking the villains to the ground. Lin and Su enter the frame as they continue to descend.)</i>   <br><br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(fist pumps and laughs)</i> Nice job, little bro.      <br><br><i>(Cut to the inside of the island as the sisters land on it. Ghazan pushes himself off the ground and Su bends up a slab of earth at him, pushing him back and making him grunt. Lin picks up the unconscious Korra and she tugs on the cables. The sisters are pulled upwards but a water arm snakes around Lin's thigh to reveal Ming-Hua struggling to retain her grip on Lin. Fire enters the screen, extinguishing the liquid and freeing Lin. Ming-Hua turns back to the brothers angrily and Mako continues to fire off another blast as Ming-Hua swipes it away. Cut to an aerial view of the moat as they continue to trade attacks. View pans off to the side where Zaheer is fighting with the two guards seen earlier. He is seen pushing himself off the ground with his staff and landing behind the guards. <br><br>Cut to a close up of Zaheer as he swipes away a rock with the glider and airbends an attack shortly after. One of the guards firebend at him while the other chucks rocks at Zaheer. The airbender dodges it swiftly and swipes out another air blast, catching the guards by surprise and they are knocked backwards. Zaheer then looks up with surprise and we cut to Lin with Korra on her shoulders as the cables quickly pull her upwards. We return back to Zaheer again.)</i><br><br><b>Zaheer:</b> No! <br><br><i>(He opens up his glider and flies up to the sisters. As he gets close, he maneuvers his body and kicks out an airbending attack. Lin swings herself aside to avoid the air blast and she grits her teeth as Zaheer comes at her. Suddenly, Su swings in and grabs Lin's cable to move her out of harm's way.

Su is relieved.)</i><br><br><b>Lin:</b> How could you let this happen? <i>(Korra brings a knee up)</i> You assured me this was one of the most <i>(Korra tries to sit up)</i> secure places in the world.          <br><b>Su:</b> It is. I don't know how this happened. Obviously this was a well-planned operation, so <i>(frowns at Lin)</i> don't blame me.    <br><br><i>(Kuvira walks to the open doorway leading to the office.)</i>      <br><br><b>Kuvira:</b> We searched the entire estate but there's no sign of them.  <br><b>Lin:</b> Well, keep looking!      <br><br><i>(Kuvira gives a bow and departs.

Cut to a view of Varrick's hands on the table.)</i><br><br><b>Varrick:</b> What was I doing last night? <i>(camera pans to Varrick's face)</i> Same thing I always do. From nine to ten,  I checked my body for ticks. Lyme Disease is a <i>serious</i> killer. <i>(Cut to everyone else in the room looking at him with disbelief)</i> Then I did my nightly <i>(view changes to Varrick standing up with a leg on a chair and exercising. Zhu Li is standing in the background.)</i> Varri-calisthenics followed by <i>(stops exercising)</i> thirty minutes of breath holding. I filmed the whole thing if you want to watch it.    <br><br><i>(Cut to Aiwei with a hand on his head. Korra has a hand on her mouth and she looks like she's about to laugh. Mako pinches his nose bridge from annoyance. Su has two hands clasped in front of her mouth.)</i><br><br><b>Aiwei:</b> That won't be necessary.      <br><br><i>(Varrick and his assistant leave the interrogation room and close the door behind them.)</i><br><br><b>Lin:</b> Maybe it wasn't a guard after all. Maybe it was someone a little <i>higher</i> up the food chain. Aiwei, why don't you question Su?          <br><b>Korra:</b> Lin, stop. Your sister wasn't involved.  <br><b>Su:</b> No, <i>(walks over to the chair)</i> I'll gladly be questioned. <i>(sits down)</i> I have nothing to hide.     <br><b>Aiwei:</b> <i>(looks to the side, a little reluctantly)</i> What is your full name?       <br><b>Su:</b> Suyin Bei Fong. I'm the daughter of Toph and <i>(glances at Lin)</i> the only sister to Lin, and I had nothing to do with the attack last night.   <br><b>Aiwei:</b> <i>(turns to Lin)</i> She is telling <i>(Korra sighs with frustration in the background)</i> the truth.   <br><b>Korra:</b> This is a waste of time. Just bring in the next guard.  <br><br><i>(Another young male guard steps in and takes a seat.)</i><br><br><b>Aiwei:</b> Give me your name and tell me where you are from. <br><b>Hong Li:</b> I'm Hong Li. I was born and raised here in Zaofu.       <br><b>Aiwei:</b> Do you have any knowledge of the people who tried to kidnap the Avatar?      <br><b>Hong Li:</b> No.              <br><b>Aiwei:</b> <i>(leans forward and suspicious music plays)</i> Did you help the attackers enter Zaofu last night?     <br><b>Hong Li:</b> No, of course not.      <br><b>Aiwei:</b> <i>(calmly)</i> You're lying.         <br><b>Hong Li:</b> <i>(shocked)</i> What? No, I'm not!      <br><b>Su:</b> <i>(storms up to Hong Li)</i> How did they get in and out?! <i>(grabs him by the armor and pulls him out of the chair to slam him against the wall)</i> Where are they now?       <br><br><b>Hong Li:</b> <i>(fearful)</i> I don't know! I'm telling you I didn't help them.       <br><br><b>Su:</b> You're a traitor to the entire clan.       <br><b>Aiwei:</b> I suggest we search his place.<br><br><i>(Hong Li's eyes widen and quiver with fright. Location changes to an apartment complex. Cut to the inside of an apartment with Team Avatar and Aiwei searching for clues. Bolin walks to the kitchen and opens the oven before closing it in disappointment. He stands up and opens a small cupboard above. Cut to Mako's hands separating some papers on a desk and he picks up a small written note.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> I got something!          <br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(mouth full of cookies)</i> What?   <br><br><i>(Bolin puts away the cookie jar and starts to eat.)</i>          <br><br><b>Mako:</b> It looks like it's from them. <i>(Cut to a close up of the writing on the note)</i> "Team assembled. Ready to rendezvous."      <br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(hands a book to Aiwei)</i> And look at this.       <br><b>Aiwei:</b> <i>(takes the book and opens it as Mako leans over to look)</i> These are the guards' log books. All their schedules and routes are in here.     <br><b>Korra:</b> That guard knows everything. <i>(Aiwei closes the book)</i> We have to get him to talk.   <br><b>Mako:</b> Let's go confront him with this evidence right now.  <br><b>Aiwei:</b> No. <i>(the teens are confused)</i> Let's give him a little time to sweat it out. He will talk eventually.<br><br><i>(Aiwei walks off and Mako glances at the truth seer suspiciously. Location changes to an overhead view ofTeam Avatar checking out the cooled down moat from last night. Naga is perfectly fine now and she walks around to sniff the rocks. A few Zaofu guards watch over the crime scene.)</i>    <br><br><b>Mako:</b> I don't understand why we're not talking to that guard right now. <i>(camera changes to a close up of team on ground)</i> Every minute we waste here, those guys get further away. I mean, <i>(his friends gather around him)</i> how does a random guard get involved with a group of super criminals, anyway?     <br><b>Asami:</b> What do you mean?       <br><b>Mako:</b> That guard is only <i>eighteen</i> years old, and has lived in Zaofu his <i>entire</i> life. Zaheer and his gang have been in prison for more than <i>thirteen</i> years. <br><b>Korra:</b> I don't know, but we all saw the evidence. It's pretty overwhelming.       <br><b>Varrick:</b> <i>(stands up from the back of a metal shield just behind Mako and Asami)</i> Maybe a little too <i>(the teens reel back in surprsie)</i> overwhelming?           <br><b>Bolin:</b> Hey, Varrick! <i>(Zhu Li walks into screen with a few rocks in hand.)</i> What are you doing here?   <br><br><i>(Varrick shimmies over the plate and stands next to the youths.)</i> <br><br><b>Varrick:</b> <i>(raises one porous stone)</i> Collecting pumice stones with Zhu Li. That lavabender did a lot of damage, but he makes a <i>nice</i> exfoliating rock. And when you got calluses like mine, <i>(nudges Asami with an arm and she looks weirded out)</i> you take all the pumice stones you can get your hands on. Or in my case, <i>(Cut to a shot of Varrick's sole as Zhu Li vigorously scrubs it with a pumice stone)</i> feet!   <br><br><i>(Cut to the teens who are disgusted except Mako who is unamused.)</i>   <br><br><b>Korra, Bolin, and Asami:</b> <i>(simultaneously)</i> Ehh...           <br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(walks up to Varrick)</i> What were you saying about the evidence?       <br><b>Varrick:</b> I was saying that I can smell a conspiracy when I see one. Look, if I was trying to set someone up, I would tell everyone he's guilty, and then plant the evidence in his apartment as proof.      <br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(crosses his arm and gives him a look)</i> Oh. <i>(leans towards Varrick)</i> You mean exactly like what you did to me?       <br><b>Varrick:</b> Yes! <i>(raises both arms with glee)</i> Just like that. Remember how great that worked? <i>(Mako continues to glare at Varrick)</i> Well, not for you.          <br><b>Mako:</b> You're right. <i>(camera pans out to the group as Zhu Li continues to exfoliate Varrick's foot)</i> All the evidence points to this guard, but maybe he's just the fall guy.          <br><b>Bolin:</b> But for who?         <br><b>Mako:</b> For the only person who can truly keep a secret in this city, Aiwei. <br><br><i>(Cut to the other three teens who are a little skeptical and surprised but consider the plan anyway. Scene changes to an aerial view of the moat and camera pans off to the right to a house on a cliff. Cut to the inside of the home looking out the window as Bolin comically stands up before popping his head down. Cut to the outside of the house where Team Avatar are crouching.)</i>     <br><br><b>Bolin:</b> He's not home. Or he's hiding in there. <i>(gasps)</i> Or he's invisible.    <br><br><i>(Mako gives him a "Really?" stare.)</i>      <br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Probably just not home.       <br><b>Mako:</b> We have to get in there and find some evidence that links Aiwei to Zaheer, otherwise Su won't believe us. <br><br><i>(Cut to the door handle inside the house as it tilts down and the door opens inwards. Mako's frame walks in followed by Korra, Bolin, and Asami. Camera pans out to the living room area as the teens walk in.

Putting them back down, she looks around behind her. Cut to the brothers as Mako opens a drawer in a desk and Bolin admires a bookshelf with some artefacts dotted throughout on them. Cut to a frontal shot of Bolin who is curious and he picks up a small, orange clay jar.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Oh, it's like a desert on a jar.          <br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(turns to his brother)</i> Bolin, put that back. We don't want Aiwei to know we were in here if we can't find anything.      <br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(puts the jar on a shelf beside a bigger pot)</i> Uh...  <br><br><i>(He pulls the jar away and hesitates.)</i>           <br><br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(takes the jar)</i> You forgot where it goes, didn't you?   <br><br><i>(He places it on the shelf near a yellow book.

I think this bookshelf slides open. <br><br><i>(He stands up and begins to push. Cut to a view from behind the shelf as it opens to reveal Bolin looking down at the camera. Mako and Korra walk up to Bolin and the earthbender walks down a hidden staircase. Switch to Bolin's back view as there a mysterious door at the foot of the steps and he pauses.)</i>         <br><br><b>Korra:</b> What do you think is down there?         <br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(optimistic)</i> Could be a storage cellar.  <br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(smiles)</i> Or it could be how Zaheer got in and out.      <br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> Aiwei's coming back. <i>(Korra and the brothers look alarmed)</i> Quick!        <br><br><i>(Cut to the bottom of the shelf as various legs run up the stairs and back into the living room. Mako slides the shelf close but it is too near to the adjacent shelf. It is obvious that the shelf is not back to its original position. Mako scampers away from the evidence and we cut to a back view of Team Avatar as a door closes and Aiwei walks into the living room. He looks at the youths with astonishment.)</i>     <br><br><b>Aiwei:</b> <i>(frowns)</i> What are you doing in my house? <br><br><i>(Cut to a close up of Aiwei as he looks like a deer in headlights.

You had better have a good explanation.       <br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(pacifies Aiwei and his brother gives him a look)</i> We do, we do. We actually knocked on your front door, and we thought we heard you say... <i>(falsetto)</i> "Come in! I'm in the bathroom!" <i>(the other three teens glare daggers at Bolin)</i> I don't even know <i>(drops his posture down, defeated)</i> why I'm saying that. You know I'm lying. And you don't even sound like that.   <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(takes a step forward)</i> We came here because things weren't adding up, and we thought you might have some answers.          <br><b>Aiwei:</b> <i>(gestures to the sofa)</i> Sit. If you want to talk, let's talk over some tea. <br><br><i>(The youths glance at each other with puzzled expressions on their faces. Cut to an empty cup as clear, green liquid is poured into it. View changes to a wide shot of the room with the teens seated and the tea cups are on the table.)</i><br><br><b>Aiwei:</b> <i>(places the teapot aside)</i> So, <i>(walks towards the small flight of steps leading to his bookshelf with his back facing the teens)</i> what is not adding up, exactly? Hong Li was clearly lying, and we found evidence in his apartment.           <br><b>Mako:</b> But don't you think it's weird how young he is? How did he ever get mixed up with this group?       <br><b>Aiwei:</b> <i>(climbs the steps)</i> Perhaps through a relative. Or maybe he was bribed. <i>(Korra and Bolin have nervous sweatdrops on their temples)</i> We will find out those answers in time. But if it wasn't him, <i>(casts a side glance to the group)</i> who do you think it was?    <br><br><i>(Once again, the youths look at each other nervously)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> We don't know.        <br><b>Aiwei:</b> You don't think <i>I</i> had <i>(brings a hand up to move the jar Bolin touched back into position)</i> something to do with this, do you?    <br><br><i>(Bolin looks down, knowing that he messed up.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> We're just looking for answers.      <br><b>Aiwei:</b> And you think you found something, don't you?   <br><br><i>(Aiwei glances at the scuff marks on the floor.)</i><br><br><b>Aiwei:</b> <i>(glances to the side again)</i> You have no idea what is coming for you, Avatar. <br><br><i>(He brings his hands up, bending up a protective wall of metal to separate him and the teens. Mako firebends at Aiwei but the flames collide harmlessly against the wall as it is fully erected. Korra gives a grunt and punches against the wall, creating a sizeable dent but it doesn't give way. The Avatar pants from the exertion.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Come on! He's getting away!          <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(annoyed)</i> I'm still a little new at this, so back off!      <br><br><i>(She closes her eyes and takes a deep breath before bending the metal again, creating a deeper dent on the wall. Korra stands up and prepares herself for one last blow. View changes to the other side of the crumpled war as it finally tears open. Korra and company proceed to walk through the hole in the wall. They carefully descend the stairs and stop at the door. Cut to Korra's hand on the handle as she pushes it open to reveal a detonator attached to a can of blasting jelly. An explosion occurs soon after and the camera slows down a bit. Cut to the fire being reflected in Korra's eyes as she is dumbfounded. View pans out to the living room as the explosion rocks the house. <br><br>Cut to Kuvira patrolling atop a cliff nearby as she brings her hands up to shield herself from the impact. She glances down at the destroyed house. Cut back to the teens who have crouched down to the floor and Korra has airbended a protective shield around them. When it is safe, Korra stops airbending and she and Mako glance up.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(stands up)</i> Argh!              <br><br><i>(She and Mako walk into the secret room. View changes to the inside of the remains of the smoking room and the benders put their arms out protectively in front of them. After a few seconds, they relax their stances.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> He's gone.          <br><b>Korra:</b> Look. <i>(Cut to a hole in the wall at the end of the room completely covered by dirt)</i> He must've escaped through there. <i>(turns to Bolin)</i> Help me clear it out.  <br><br><i>(The duo swing their arms to the side and the debris parts in the middle.)</i>    <br><br><b>Lin:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> What happened? <i>(view changes to the Bei Fong sisters entering the secret room)</i> We heard an explosion.     <br><b>Su:</b> Where is Aiwei?           <br><b>Korra:</b> Your trusted advisor was the one who betrayed us. <i>(Su is slackjawed)</i> He was lying about the guard.  <br><b>Su:</b> <i>(widens her eyes)</i> What? <i>(her eyes shift around side to side)</i> No.               <br><b>Korra:</b> We confronted him and he bolted through <i>(gestures to the hole in the wall)</i> here.   <br><br><i>(Lin takes a step forward and slams her foot on the floor. Camera changes to a black and white shot of Lin's earthbending seismic sight. The waves move out from her foot towards the gaping hole. Lin retracts her foot and camera returns back to its original colored shot.)</i><br><br><b>Lin:</b> He must have collapsed the tunnel behind him.     <br><b>Mako:</b> And he rigged an explosion to destroy any evidence that might have been here.      <br><b>Korra:</b> This is where Zaheer got in and out. Aiwei was the traitor.     <br><b>Su:</b> <i>(disappointed)</i> I... <i>(narrows her eyes)</i> trusted him.      <br><br><i>(Kuvira runs into the room.)</i>    <br><br><b>Kuvira:</b> Is everyone okay?       <br><b>Lin:</b> <i>(to the guard)</i>  Aiwei is a fugitive. Get all available guards to search the mountainside and find out where this tunnel exits immediately! <br><br><i>(The guard climbs up the stairs to leave the house. Lin lays a hand on Su's shoulder as a gesture of comfort. Scene changes to the front doors of Su's house. View switches again to everyone hanging around in Su's office-study. Running footsteps are heard off-screen and we soon see Kuvira enter the room, standing at attention.)</i><br><br><b>Lin:</b> What did you find?          <br><b>Kuvira:</b> We located the end of the tunnel, but there's no sign of him. Just some fresh tire tracks.  <br><br><i>(Lin gives a nod to the guard and Mako steps away from the table he was leaning against.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> He had an escape plan all ready to go.        <br><b>Su:</b> <i>(slightly hunched over on the sofa)</i> I trusted him with my life. I thought we were family, <i>(closes her eyes)</i> but it was all a lie. <br><b>Mako:</b> Whoever these guys are, they're more powerful than we thought. And more dangerous.       <br><b>Korra:</b> That's why we have to find them. We're going to hold off our search for airbenders and hunt down Aiwei. Naga can track his scent.       <br><b>Asami:</b> And I bet if we find Aiwei, we'll find Zaheer.          <br><b>Lin:</b> No. <i>(the teens are taken aback and Lin stands up)</i> We're not hunting this group. There could be other secret agents in other parts of the world looking for you right now. I'm taking you back to Republic City where I can protect you.  <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(raises an eyebrow slightly)</i> If I wasn't safe here, then I'm not safe anywhere! I have to stop them.      <br><b>Lin:</b> It's too dangerous. You are not going!          <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(irritated)</i> Stop trying to protect me. <i>(narrows her eyes)</i> I'm the Avatar, this is my job! <br><b>Lin:</b> <i>(talks back)</i> Don't lecture me about jobs! <br><b>Su:</b> Enough! <i>(stands up)</i> Korra, listen to Lin.      <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(surprised)</i> But. They-          <br><b>Su:</b> <i>(interrupts)</i> Please. Lin's only looking out for you. I promise you Aiwei and everyone he's working with will be brought to justice.   <br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(glances to the side)</i> Fine. If you really think it's best. <br><b>Su:</b> I do.             <br><b>Lin:</b> <i>(smiles and lays a hand on her sister's shoulder)</i> Thank you, Su.        <br><b>Su:</b> Everyone should get some rest tonight. I'll have my people prep your airship and you can leave first thing in the morning.   <br><br><i>(Wistful music plays and we cut to one of the guest house apartments.

Why?          <br><b>Su:</b> Because I want you to hunt down Aiwei and bring him back to me.       <br><b>Bolin:</b> But you said-        <br><b>Su:</b> I said what Lin wanted to hear, and I bought you guys some time. <i>(gives the teens a soft smile)</i> Go. I'll deal with Lin in the morning.       <br><br><i>(Cut to a frontal shot of Korra with her friends behind her and she turns around to address them.)</i>  <br><br><b>Korra:</b> Let's get this guy. <br><br><i>(They smile. Cut to Su as Korra throws her arms around the older woman, giving her a hug. Su is shocked by the gesture.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Thanks.             <br><br><i>(Su returns the hug and smiles.

Cut to a close up of the group as Asami pulls in the jeep behind Korra.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(looks up)</i> Aiwei's <i>definitely</i> been through here. <i>(pets Naga's side)</i> Nice tracking, girl.<br><b>Mako:</b> Let's ask around. Maybe someone's seen him.<br><br><i>(Cut to the inside of a tavern as Mako pushes the curtain aside at the entrance. A couple of customers glance at them. As the team walks in, something catches Bolin's attention from the side and camera pans to reveal a wanted poster of him on the wall.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Ooh, look, they have a mover poster of me! <i>(Mako looks at the poster with mild surprise)</i> Must be big Nuktuk fans. <i>(rubs hands together)</i> Yeah. <i>(he starts to walk forward)</i> I should go over <i>(Mako grabs Bolin by his sleeve)</i> and say hello.<br><b>Mako:</b> No, those are <i>wanted</i> posters, <i>(camera zooms out to reveal the wanted posters for the other three members on the team)</i> and there's one for each of us. <i>(Cut to a close up of Korra's poster as Mako reads the details off-screen)</i> "Wanted by Her Majesty, the Earth Queen, for crimes against the kingdom." <i>(Cut to Mako as he raises an eyebrow while Korra is fuming behind him.)</i> I'm guessing this is because we took her airbenders?<br><b>Korra:</b> They weren't hers to keep! I swear, if i ever see her pinchy <i>(Asami glances back into the tavern)</i> little queen face again, I am gonna- <br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(interrupts with alarm)</i> Uh, guys. <br><br><i>(Camera pans across the various patrons of the bar and one guy pulls out his sword while another shows off his spear.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> We should get out of here.<br><br><i>(The teens leave the establishment and Korra does an "I'm watching you" gesture to the customers before she departs.<br><br>Scene changes to an aerial view of Su's house in the morning with the remnants of the battle lingering in the shot. View switches to Su talking to two guards on the bridge as Lin walks towards her sister.)</i><br><br><b>Lin:</b> Where is everyone? I've been waiting to leave for half an hour.<br><b>Su:</b> And good morning to you too, Lin. Now, don't get mad. Korra's fine. I'm just waiting to hear if she tracked down Aiwei yet.<br><b>Lin:</b> <i>(furrows her brows)</i> What? You let Korra go?! I thought we were on the same page about this, and then you go stab me in the back?<br><b>Su:</b> Oh, don't be so overdramatic. You can't control the Avatar's every move.<br><b>Lin:</b> <i>(storms off)</i> I can try.<br><br><i>(Exciting music plays and we cut to Naga running with Korra on her back. Camera pans out to an aerial view of Team Avatar making their way down a path on the road. The jeep follows closely and Naga runs up a small slope. View switches to Naga sniffing the ground near a bunch of rocks.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Naga found something.<br><br><i>(Korra gets off her mount and Naga sits. The Avatar earthbends a giant boulder aside to reveal a jeep hidden behind a small clearing. Naga then gives Korra a nudge and awaits a reward.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Oh, sorry. I forgot to bring treats, <i>(Naga whines and bends down as Korra affectionate rubs the polar bear-dog's face.)</i> but good girl.<br><br><i>(Naga whines once more and turns to walk away. Her tail slaps against Korra's face and the Avatar groans in shock. Asami and the brothers are seen walking up to the escape vehicle in the background. Korra hunches her shoulder's from Naga's cold shoulder attitude.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> This must be Aiwei's jeep. He can't be far.<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(walks to the edge of the slope)</i> Bolin and I <i>(Cut to a view of a town nearby in the background)</i> will investigate the Misty Palms Oasis and see if he's holed up there.<br><b>Bolin:</b> Yes, I love it when you talk like a cop!<br><b>Korra:</b> I'm coming too. <br><b>Mako:</b> No. You and Asami wait here in case he comes back. Besides, we don't want to call too much attention to ourselves.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(reluctantly)</i> Alright. <br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(excitedly)</i> Ooh. Mako, Mako, Mako, we should wear disguises and pretend we're going undercover. That way, <i>(places a hand over his mouth and another on his forehead)</i> no one will recognize us. <i>(laughs)</i> Police work is so exciting!<br><br><i>(Scene changes to a hand unzipping a bag of supplies. Camera pans out to a back view of Bolin as he pulls out a bright yellow raincoat and drapes it over his head and body. Cut to his eyes as bright green goggles are worn. Camera pans out to the brothers dressed in identical outfits. Cut to Korra and Asami as they look at each other, not convinced by the disguises.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> All right, now we need our undercover identities. <i>(Camera focuses on Bolin now as he regales a sad story)</i> I'm an ex-United Forces operative named Ting-Ting. War was the only woman I ever loved, until Ivy came along and showed me what real love is! Tragically, she was taken from me by my arch enemy Dr. Razor, and he-<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(interrupts)</i> Enough. <i>(starts walking)</i> Let's just find Aiwei.<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(sad)</i> But I haven't even told you <i>your</i> backstory.<br><b>Mako:</b> I'm a cop. I don't have a backstory.<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(catches up to his brother)</i> Ooh, you're good at this!<br><br><i>(Camera fades away to the brothers walking up to the town entrance. View changes to the spirits perched on the rooftop and telephone lines of the town as they look down at the brothers. Cut to a close up of the brothers as they make their way down the street. View focuses on the ice spring of the Misty Palms Oasis and we can see that the ice has grown significantly since "The Library" episode back in the original series. A few spirits lounge about on the cooling ice. The brothers pause and watch a tavern owner pushing three tiny kiwi bird-like spirits out of the door with a broom.)</i><br><br><b>Tavern Owner:</b> Shoo. Human customers only.<br><br><i>(The spirits scurry off.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Let's see if this guy knows anything. <i>(the brothers walk up to the tavern owner sweeping his stoop)</i> Excuse me, sir. <i>(the owner stops sweeping)</i> We're looking <i>(Mako and Bolin pull off the goggles from their faces)</i> for a man about sixty, balding, wearing glasses, and a long green robe.<br><b>Bolin:</b> And he's got this weird piercing that goes from his nose <i>(points to his nose)</i> to his ear. <i>(points to his ear)</i> Freaks me out. <br><b>Tavern Owner:</b> Yeah, sure. Sounds like a guy who came in last night. I told him I had the best drinks in the Earth Kingdom, and he called me a liar.<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(smiles hopefully)</i> That's him. Any idea where he is now?<br><b>Tavern Owner:</b> No, afraid not. But he was right. <i>(his posture looks defeated)</i> My drinks are terrible. <br><br><i>(The owner walks away dejectedly into his bar while the brothers look on in shock.<br><br>Scene changes to Korra sitting on a cliff, looking at the Misty Palms Oasis in the background. View changes to a frontal shot of Korra with Asami in the background glancing at her friend as she checks out the jeep.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> Are you okay?<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(sighs)</i> I'm just frustrated. What does Zaheer want with me? What's his plan? <br><br><i>(Asami slides up the driver's seat as she reaches for something in the glove compartment. Cut to a close up of Sato as she pulls out a note.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> I don't know, <i>(smiles)</i> but I think I found a clue.<br><br><i>(Korra turns around and gets off her perch. Walking to Asami, the older teen hands Korra the message.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> "Xai Bau's Grove, sundown." This must be where and when Aiwei's going to meet Zaheer.<br><br><i>(Asami pulls out a map from Aiwei's jeep and lays it on jeep's bonnet.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(drags her finger across the map)</i> All right, Xai Bau's Grove. <i>(Cut to Asami's gloved hand on the map of the Si Wong Desert.)</i> Where are you? <br><br><i>(A blue crow spirit lands and makes a caw. Cut to the girls to see that more crow spirits have landed on the car. Both of them wave and shoo the spirits away.)</i> <br><br><b>Asami:</b> Go away. I'm trying to find something.<br><br><i>(View changes back into the Misty Palms Oasis and we cut to Bolin leaning against the wall next to an earthen pot. A dark purple bunny-like spirit with extremely long ears and sharp teeth emerges from the jar, catching Bolin's attention.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Well, aren't you <i>(bends down with a hand extended)</i> a cute little- <i>(the spirit bites him)</i> Ow! Hey!<br><br><i>(The earthbender sticks a finger in his mouth and glances at a couple across the street inside a booth. The male nudges his female companion and the woman looks up at him, confused. He then nudges his head towards Bolin and the woman turns to the indicated direction. Cut to a close up of Bolin's green eyes as they widen. Camera pans out to the bunny spirit slinking back into its hiding spot as Mako steps out of the building.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(to his brother)</i> No luck here.<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(whispers)</i> I think there might be a couple bounty hunters <i>(Mako looks up)</i> over there who recognize me.<br><br><i>(View changes to the couple in the booth looking a little serious and they step out. Cut back to the brothers.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> We've been made. Let's lose 'em.<br><br><i>(Exciting chase music plays as they run down the street with the couple following after them. The brothers duck into an alley and hide behind a pile of crates as the couple runs past. The female stops and looks into the alley as Bolin crouches some more from behind the crate so she won't spot him. The woman then walks off. The brothers carefully peer out from behind their safe spot.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Okay, I think we're clear. We should head back to Korra before someone <i>(Aiwei walks past the alley just behind Mako)</i> else recognizes us. <i>(Bolin grabs his brother and pulls him to the wall)</i><br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(whispers)</i> We could, or we could follow Aiwei instead. Look.<br><br><i>(Bolin points off-screen and view changes to Aiwei eating from a take-out box as he walks down the street. The brothers peer out of the alley to spy on him.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> All right, <i>(brings the goggles up to his face)</i> play it cool. <i>(walks out of the alley to trail Aiwei)</i> Follow me lead.<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(holds his goggles)</i> Ting-Ting always finds his man. <br><br><i>(Bolin slaps the goggles onto his face and we cut to an overhead shot of the brothers running up and taking cover behind an inn. Aiwei continues to walk forward, unaware of the commotion behind him. Cut to a close up of the siblings and they peer around the corner. Camera pans right to reveal Aiwei entering a room.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Keep an eye on him. I'll go get Korra.<br><br><i>(Location changes to the cliff where Asami and Korra are glancing down at the map. Naga can be seen sleeping in the foreground. Mako's head pops in from the background and he is holding the yellow raincoat in his hand.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> We found Aiwei hiding in an inn.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(turns around to face Mako and smiles)</i> That's great. <br><b>Asami:</b> We found something too. <i>(holds the paper out to Mako who takes it)</i> It looks like he's going to meet Zaheer at sundown <i>(Mako glances at the letter)</i> at a place called Xai Bau's Grove, <i>(she lifts up the map, frustrated)</i> but I can't find it anywhere on the map.<br><b>Korra:</b> Let's go bust Aiwei's door down and finally get some answers.<br><b>Mako:</b> No. Once Aiwei knows we're on to him, we lose our advantage. I say we stake out his room, and when he leaves for this meeting, we follow him.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(Cut to Korra who looks serious)</i> And he'll lead us straight to Zaheer.<br><br><i>(Cut to commercial break.)</i><br><br><br><br><b><u>Act II</u></b><br><br><i>(Episode returns to a view of a desert and camera pans down to an aerial view of the Misty Palms Inn. Naga sits outside the building while Team Avatar walks into the establishment. Cut to a close up of Naga looking at down Pabu play with a yellow bean-like spirit. View changes to the check-in counter at the inn.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(smiles and speaks politely)</i> Good afternoon. We'd like a room on the ground floor across from 102, please.<br><b>Innkeeper:</b> Forget it. Last time a bunch of teenagers came in here, they trashed the whole room.<br><br><i>(Mako frowns and the stalkers from earlier stop at the inn's entrance.)</i><br><br><b>Muscly Man:</b> We found you!<br><br><i>(The team turns around in alarm and get into fighting poses. Mako lights up a ball of fire above his palm and Korra bends fire daggers in both hands.)</i><br><br><b>Innkeeper:</b> Hey, no bending in here! Take it outside.<br><b>Muscly Man:</b> <i>(places both hands out to appease the team)</i> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. <i>(a goofy smile appears on the couple's faces)</i> We're not here to fight you. We're here to meet Nuktuk.<br><br><i>(The theme song from the Nuktuk mover plays and the woman reaches behind her to undo the cap on a cylindrical container before removing a poster from it. She walks towards Bolin with a pen in hand as well and Mako along with Korra stop firebending. Everyone relaxes their stances. The woman unfurls a poster of Nuktuk carrying Ginger.)</i><br><br><b>Intense Woman:</b> We're your biggest fans. <i>(camera pans up to the woman's slightly crazed expression)</i> Could you make it out to Lily and Macao?<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(awkwardly)</i> Uh, I'd be happy to. <i>(Mako gives a "Really?" expression in the background as Bolin takes the pen)</i> Always love meeting my fans.<br><br><i>(Bolin gives a forced smile as he signs the poster and glances to Lily nervously. The woman straightens her hair out and bites her lip before realizing that she forgot something. Reaching to her side pocket, Lily pulls out a Nuktuk plushie.)</i><br><br><b>Intense Woman:</b> I made this Nuktuk doll for you.<br><br><i>(The woman is obviously in high heaven that she is meeting Bolin and she pushes the doll at Bolin's face, making the doll squeak.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(starts to smile)</i> Aww... It's... cute.<br><br><i>(Lily squeaks the doll in a sound of agreement. We cut back to the innkeeper at the desk as Mako and Korra look on.)</i><br><br><b>Innkeeper:</b> Why didn't you tell me your friend was a mover star? I'd be happy to rent you any room in the inn.<br><b>Mako:</b> We'll just take the one across from 102.<br><b>Innkeeper:</b> But that room is too small for the four of you.<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(crosses his arms and smiles)</i> Trust me. It'll be perfect.<br><br><i>(Cut to a close up of Bolin looking miserable.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> I'd just like to state for the record that this room is not perfect. <i>(Naga's tail wags and slaps against Bolin's face, causing fur to fly about)</i> Naga!<br><br><i>(View changes to a full view of the very cramped room as Naga lies on her back on the bed while Pabu naps on top of a chest of drawers. Bolin coughs and spits out the fur that got into his mouth. Asami sits in front of the drawers while Korra sits on a stool to look out the window alongside Mako who is standing and has the drapes gently pulled aside. Cut to a close up of the duo in front of the window and we switch to Mako's point of view looking out as Aiwei pops up from the window of his own room.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> There he is.<br><br><i>(View switches to a close up of Aiwei glancing around before looking a little dejected and dropping his hands, allowing the curtains to close fully. Scene returns back to the inside of Team Avatar's room. Bolin is now walking around the room with his arms crossed behind his hand.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> I thought stakeouts were supposed to be exciting. This isn't. At all. <i>(he pauses in front of the drawers and it catches his attention)</i> Ooh, I wonder if there's any snacks in here. <br><br><i>(Cut to a close up of Bolin's hand as it opens up the top drawer which contains a yellow book that Gang had in his drawer back in the police station in Book 2. Bolin shuts the drawer and pulls out the bottom one which reveals a Pai Sho Rules handbook along with the tiles and board used for the game.)</i> <br><br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(gasps off-screen)</i> Hey look! <i>(view changes to Bolin pulling out the board)</i> A Pai Sho board. Mako, you want to play?<br><br><i>(View changes to Mako who continues to look out of the window)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Kind of busy here, bro.<br><br><i>(Cut to Bolin looking a little disappointed and Asami gives Bolin a smile)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> I'll play. <br><b>Bolin:</b> Oh, well... No offense, but I learned Street Pai Sho from Shady Shin, <i>(waves a hand down in dismissal)</i> and I am <i>pretty</i> good, so wouldn't really be a fair game.<br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(arches an eyebrow)</i> So? I learned to play from my Dad, the diabolical genius. <i>(smirks)</i> I'll <i>destroy</i> you.<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(switch to a close up of Bolin looking very smug)</i> Well, looks like we have ourselves <i>(camera zooms in rapidly on his green eyes as they turn serious)</i> a Pai Sho-down. <br><br><i>(View changes to the duo setting up the tiles on the board in front of the bed with Pabu and Naga looking at them curiously)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(gestures a hand out to Asami)</i> Ladies first.<br><br><i>(Asami makes the first move, followed by Bolin. Both of them make their second move after that. Asami is about to make the next move before she puts a hand on her mouth to think. Wistful music plays.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> Hmm.<br><b>Bolin:</b> I don't want to rush you, but let's speed things up a bit.<br><br><i>(Asami puts her hand back on the board and she looks at Bolin, a little amused.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> Why? This game is all about slow, methodical strategy.<br><b>Bolin:</b> No, it's not; this is a fast-paced, edge-of-your-seat game of chance. Don't think. Just go.<br><b>Asami:</b> I don't know what Shady Shin taught you, but it wasn't the <i>real</i> Pai Sho.<br><b>Bolin:</b> Oh, really? I think our friend <i>(picks up the rule book and waves it as Asami)</i> Mr. Rule Book might disagree with you. <i>(reads the book and we can see that both Naga and Pabu have fallen asleep)</i> "The origins of Pai Sho date back over ten thousand years. It is a game of both strategy <i>and</i> chance." <i>(confused)</i> Wait, how could it be both? <br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(takes the book from Bolin)</i> Let me see that. <i>(narrates)</i> "There have been countless variations of Pai Sho through the centuries, and each culture has its <i>(frowns slightly)</i> own rules and variations on the game."<br><br><i>(Cut to a shot from outside the window looking into the room)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b>  That's no help at all. Korra, as the Avatar, you need to standardize these Pai Sho rules.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(sarcastically)</i> Okay. I'll put that on my to-do list right after "Bringing back the Air Nation" and <i>(turns to Bolin and gestures a hand out)</i> "Taking down the group that tried to kidnap me."<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(missing the point)</i> That's cool. Whenever you get to it.<br><b>Mako:</b> Assuming we <i>(Korra turns towards Mako)</i> do find Zaheer, what then?<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(frowns)</i> Then I make <i>(punches a fist into her palm)</i> him talk.<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(calmly)</i> He was locked away for thirteen years, Korra, and never broke. I don't think a little bending is going to intimidate this guy.<br><b>Korra:</b> You have a better idea? <br><b>Mako:</b> Yeah, we <i>spy</i> on them. If Aiwei and Zaheer don't know they're being watched, they'll talk freely. Then we'll know who they are and what they want.<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> That's just like Pai Sho! <i>(Cut to Bolin reading from the rule book again)</i> "In order to defeat your opponent, you first have to <i>know</i> your opponent."<br><b>Asami:</b> Then I guess I know you pretty well. <i>(Asami reaches down and jumps her a tile over a few of Bolin's.)</i> I win.<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(grabs his hair in shock)</i> What?! <i>(relaxes)</i> All right, all right. You know what? That was just a fluke. Best two out of three.<br><br><i>(Jazz music plays and we cut to Asami's hand jumping over the tiles and winning again. View changes from outside the window looking in once more. Korra and Mako continue to keep watch and casually ignore what's happening behind them.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Oh, come on! Best four out of seven.<br><br><i>(Switch to Asami's hand laying the winning move on the board and a takeout food box rests at the side of the board. Cut to Bolin eating out of his box with Pabu on his shoulder and the fire ferret has noodles all over its body.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Eight out of fifteen.<br><br><i>(Pabu digs his head into the food again. Camera slides to a profile shot of Asami laying the winning move again.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(View switches to Bolin who looks distressed)</i> Seventeen out of... <i>(pauses to think)</i> thirty-three?<br><br><i>(View changes to the duo keeping watch on the window. Camera fades to Korra stretching and yawning as Asami looks amused while continuing to play Pai Sho. Camera fades again and we can see the change in lighting, indicating that the sun is about to set. Korra is standing up now and grabbing the drapes to peer out of the window. The teens on the floor continue their game. Camera fades to an overhead shot of Bolin's hand on the board making a move.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Haha! <i>(Asami looks surprised)</i> Looks like you're on the ropes this time.<br><b>Asami:</b> I can't believe it. You might actually win this one.<br><br><i>(Bolin looks smug until Pabu jumps down on the board with the Nuktuk plushie in his mouth. The fire ferret messes and fcscatters the tiles.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(in horror)</i> No, Pabu! Why?<br><br><i>(Bolin falls to the floor in a fetal position and we can hear a ripping noise followed by a squeak. The head of the Nuktuk doll rolls into screen. View changes to the outside of the rooms surrounding a pool at sunset. We return back to the inside of Team Avatar's room.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> It's almost sundown. <i>(gestures an arm out)</i> Why hasn't Aiwei left yet? <i>(crosses her arms)</i><br><b>Asami:</b> Maybe he slipped out when you weren't looking.<br><b>Mako:</b> No, I just saw him peeking out the window fifteen minutes ago. <i>(lifts up a black logbook)</i> It's in my logbook.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(turns and walks away)</i> I'm going over there. <br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(shocked)</i> Korra, wait. You're gonna blow our element of surprise.<br><br><i>(Korra opens the door and leaves anyway. Mako follows. View changes to the outside as Korra stalks across towards Aiwei's room with her three friends running to catch up to her. Cut to the door inside Aiwei's room and it opens inwards to reveal that Korra kicked it in with airbending.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> It's over, <i>(walks in)</i> Aiwei. Where's- <i>(widens her eyes and camera pans to Aiwei seated in the lotus position on his bed with his eyes closed)</i> What?<br><br><i>(Cut to a full view of the room as Korra is dumbfounded. The remaining trio walk into the room and Bolin peers at Aiwei curiously.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> That's a <i>weird</i> way to nap. <br><b>Korra:</b> He's not sleeping. <i>(furrows her brows)</i> He's meditating. <i>(widens her eyes)</i> Wait. <i>(turns to Miss Sato)</i> Asami, those spirits were trying to tell us something earlier. Xai Bau's Grove isn't on the map because it's not in the Physical World. It's in the Spirit World! <i>(sits on the bed in front of Aiwei)</i> I'm going in after him.<br><b>Mako:</b> We'll watch him in case he wakes up. <i>(Korra inhales and exhales)</i> Be <i>careful</i>.<br><br><i>(Korra looks up at her friend and she puts her hands together, closing her eyes. Camera zooms in on her face and it flashes to Korra in the Spirit World. She opens her eyes and looks around. The grove is bathed in an orange hue with trees and rocky cliffs surrounding it. A giant whale spirit flies by above Korra. The Avatar walks up a small slope and stops beside a tree. She sees Aiwei waiting near a big rain tree and she's about to storm up to him before ducking behind her tree. Zaheer materializes under the rain tree and glares at Aiwei.)</i><br><br><b>Zaheer:</b> What happened back in Zaofu? You told me we wouldn't have any problems getting the Avatar. Because of you, we've all been compromised.<br><b>Aiwei:</b> <i>(raises both arms up)</i> No, any evidence was destroyed <i>(clasps his hands)</i> when my library burned.<br><b>Zaheer:</b> <i>(walks up to Aiwei)</i> Where is your physical body now?<br><b>Aiwei:</b> <i>(a little nervous)</i> At the Misty Palms Inn. But there is no need to worry, I was not followed.<br><b>Zaheer:</b> You left a loose end.<br><b>Aiwei:</b> I assure you no one knows anything about us.<br><b>Zaheer:</b> No, <i>(Cut to a close up of an enraged Zaheer)</i> you are the loose end.<br><br><i>(Zaheer grabs Aiwei and we cut to Korra coming out from behind the tree.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Zaheer!<br><br><i>(View changes to Zaheer who is surprised but quickly disappears. Cut to a view of a cliff above The Fog of Lost Souls as the airbender materializes on it and tosses Aiwei down into the fog below. The truth seer screams as he falls. Zaheer looks down with no sympathy before vanishing. Scene changes back to Korra waiting near the rain tree and looking around suspiciously. Zaheer materializes behind her and the Avatar turns around to face him.)</i><br><br><b>Zaheer:</b> It seems Aiwei was mistaken. <i>(gives a small smile)</i> He was followed. <br><b>Korra:</b> That's right. We knew he'd lead us straight to you. So what did you do with him?<br><b>Zaheer:</b> He'll be spending eternity in The Fog of Lost Souls, <i>(Cut to a close up of Zaheer looking rather malicious)</i> which just leaves the two of us.<br><br><i>(He gives a smile again and we cut to commercial break.)</i><br><br><br><br><b><u>Act III</u></b><br><br><i>(Episode returns to Zaheer and Korra confronting each other at Xai Bau's Grove. View switches to Zaheer's feet as they shuffle.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> Don't move, Zaheer. <i>(his feet stops)</i> You're gonna give me some answers.<br><br><i>(Cut to Korra in an offensive stance. View returns back to Zaheer who sits down in the lotus position under the huge rain tree.)</i><br><br><b>Zaheer:</b> There's no need for aggression. Neither of us has our bending, and I'm not going anywhere. I'll answer whatever questions you have. You deserve that much. <i>(Korra is confused and relaxes her stance just a bit. Zaheer softens his expression to help convince her.)</i> What would you like to know?<br><b>Korra:</b> First off, who are you people, and why do you keep trying to take me?<br><b>Zaheer:</b> We are part of a secret society dedicated to restoring freedom to the World. <i>We</i> are the Red Lotus. <br><b>Korra:</b> Red Lotus? Are you related to the White Lotus?<br><b>Zaheer:</b> We are what the White Lotus was meant to be. But after the hundred year war, the White Lotus lost its true purpose. Its members came out of hiding and openly served the Avatar. They became nothing but glorified bodyguards who served corrupt nations. So a great man named Xai Bau broke from the White Lotus and began his own society.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(warily)</i> That's a great story, but it doesn't explain why you tried to take me when I was a kid.<br><b>Zaheer:</b> That was Unalaq's idea.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(her eyes are wide with surprise)</i> What? <i>(she takes a step back)</i> My uncle was part of the Red Lotus?<br><br><i>(Scene changes to a cave at night with the crickets chirping in the background. From the outside, we can see a campfire burning inside the cave. Cut to the inner part of the cave with Zaheer meditating in the lotus position and the rest of his friends are resting in the background.)</i><br><br><b>Zaheer:</b> <i>(whispers)</i> Avatar Korra. <i>(the trio turn towards him)</i> Misty Palms Inn. <i>(Ghazan and P'li lean forward to listen closely)</i> Find her. <br><b>P'li:</b> <i>(turns her head to the earthbender and waterbender)</i> You two go. I'll stay here and make sure Zaheer's body is safe.<br><br><i>(Without another word, Ghazan and Ming-Hua stand to leave the cave. Location changes back to Xai Bau's Grove and Korra has taken a seat in the lotus position on the grass in front of the rain tree.)</i><br><br><b>Zaheer:</b> I met your uncle when I was a teenager after we had both joined the Red Lotus. We learned about Raava and Vaatu and how Avatar Wan foolishly severed them, disrupting the balance of the World forever.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(frowns)</i> Avatar Wan wasn't foolish. He was trying to restore balance.<br><b>Zaheer:</b> He closed the portals, severing humans from spirits. Even you realize the error in his ways.<br><b>Korra:</b> So all along, you and my uncle planned to use me to open the portals and release Vaatu? That's why you tried to take me when I was a kid?<br><b>Zaheer:</b> Yes, and with members of the Red Lotus as your elemental masters, we could've taught you <i>so</i> much.<br><b>Korra:</b> Sounds like you wanted to brainwash me so I'd do whatever you wanted.<br><b>Zaheer:</b> No, Korra. All I wanted was to show the Avatar a better path for the World.<br><br><i>(Cut to a close up of Korra who looks uncertain. Camera fades back to Korra with her eyes closed in the Physical World. Everyone else is resting but Mako stands beside the window and continues to keep an eye outside. He suddenly looks alarmed. Cut to his point of view of Ghazan and Ming-Hua walking around the swimming pool.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Uh, I don't know how, <i>(Bolin starts to wake up)</i> but Water Arm Lady and Lava Guy found us. <i>(Bolin gasps loudly)</i><br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(stands)</i> How?<br><b>Mako:</b> I just said I don't know how.<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(shakes Korra's shoulders)</i> Korra, come on, wake up.<br><b>Asami:</b> What do we do? <br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(carries Korra)</i> Get Korra out of here. <br><br><i>(Cut to Naga and Pabu as they wake up. Camera pans to the left to reveal that Mako has placed Korra on Naga's back.)</i> <br><br><b>Mako:</b> Bolin and I will hold them off.<br><br><i>(View switches to Ming-Hua with Ghazan peering into a room. A door opens off-screen and camera angle changes to Mako opening the door in Aiwei's room. Naga runs out soon after with Asami holding the unconscious Korra. Asami glances at two Red Lotus members as they make their escape.)</i><br><br><b>Ming-Hua:</b> <i>(switch to a close up of Ming-Hua)</i> The Avatar!<br><br><i>(Cut to an alley leading into the sleeping area of the inn as Naga runs into it and off-screen. Three shards of ice fly in soon after and smashes against the building. Ming-Hua propels herself off the ground towards the alley and extends a water arm out but a burst of fire from Mako evaporates the liquid. Mako sends another fire blast and Ming-Hua swipes it aside. Bolin bends a trail of earth towards Ghazan who jumps back. The lavabender changes the earth into lava and sends it back to the brothers as they tuck and roll away from the lava. As they land in squatting position, the camera focuses on Ming-Hua and Ghazan who are smiling.<br><br>Scene changes back to Xai Bau's Grove.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> If my uncle came up with a plan to abduct me when was a kid, why wasn't <i>he</i> caught?<br><b>Zaheer:</b> He wasn't with us that night, and he covered up his involvement afterwards.<br><b>Korra:</b> So he betrayed you just like he betrayed me. <br><b>Zaheer:</b> <i>(closes his eyes and nods)</i> Yes. <i>(opens his eyes)</i> He allowed me and my friends to remain imprisoned while he pursued his own selfish goals. Unalaq becoming a Dark Avatar was never part of our mission.<br><b>Korra:</b> And what is your <i>mission</i> exactly?<br><b>Zaheer:</b> I want what you want, to restore balance to this World.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(gives a short laugh)</i> I don't think our ideas of balance are the same.<br><b>Zaheer:</b> Are you sure about that? You kept the spirit portals open, but why stop there? Bringing the spirits back should only be the beginning.<br><b>Korra:</b> What do you mean?<br><b>Zaheer:</b> The idea of having nations and governments is as foolish as keeping the human and spirit realms separate. You've had to deal with a moronic President and a tyrannical Queen. Don't you think the world would be better off if leaders like them were eliminated?<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(shocked)</i> No. <i>(hestitant)</i> I mean, I don't really agree with what they've done, but taking out World Leaders isn't the answer.<br><b>Zaheer:</b> It wasn't too long ago that the airbenders were nearly all wiped out thanks to the Fire Lord's desire for World Dominance. True freedom can only be achieved when oppressive governments are torn down.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(frowns)</i> But that won't bring balance. It will throw the world into chaos.<br><b>Zaheer:</b> Exactly. The natural order is disorder. Do you know who once said, "New growth cannot exist without <i>first</i> the destruction of the old"?<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(glares)</i> No.<br><b>Zaheer:</b> The wise Guru Laghima, an <i>airbender</i>.<br><br><i>(Korra's expression changes to that of doubt. Scene changes to Mako running and rolling across a wooden plank on the roof top while dodging Ming-Hua's water arm. He sends out a blast of fire but Ming-Hua intercepts the attack, creating steam. Before it can clear, she unleashes another attack at Mako, breaking the plank under his feet. The firebender jumps and rolls away. As he stands up, he ducks to avoid Ming-Hua's water arm and he throws up fire to block the second attack. <br><br>Mako jumps off the roof top as Ming-Hua slams her arm down into the rock at just where Mako was standing. Cut to the ground as Mako lands with a tuck and roll and quickly pushes himself off the ground to run away from Ming-Hua who jumps down and pursues him. Bolin comes into screen holding a slab of earth protectively in front of his body. A stream of lava comes in frame and shatters the earth shield. Bolin bends another chunk of earth at Ghazan who jumps against the chunk, making it crumble into dust. The lavabender goes after Bolin.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(taking a step back)</i> I can't beat this guy!  <i>(he earthbends a mound of earth as more lava collides again it)</i> It's like I'm giving him ammo. Want to trade?<br><br><i>(View switches to Mako as a water arm from Ming-Hua shoots out to attack his feet but he runs up the wall and does a quick cartwheel. While he's upside down, the frame rate slows down as Mako chops the water arm with his fire. Frame rate returns to normal as Mako lands on his feet and he punches more fire but a stream of water comes in and encases his hand in ice and he is pushed against the door behind him. Cut to a profile shot of Mako as Ming-Hua brings her face close and gives him a slasher smile. With him still attached to her water arm, she swings it out, causing Mako to fly about in an arc before smashing into a wooden door. <br><br>Bolin comes into frame and casts a quick glance at his fallen brother before turning his head back to Ghazan soon after. The earthbender bends up two slabs of earth but Ghazan jumps over the mound and turns them into lava. Ghazan bends up three lava chunks and sends them to Bolin. Cut to Bolin running alongside the pool as he dodges the lava rocks. He then dives into the pool and scene changes to underwater as more lava is sent into the water. Bolin kicks his legs and propels himself forward to avoid the attacks. He presses himself against the wall of the pool and two more lava slabs fly into the water. Cut to a close up of Bolin who is disoriented and looks like he's about to run out of air. Switch to his point of view looking up at Ming-Hua standing at the edge of the pool. The waterbender waves her arms around and encases Bolin in a bubble. Cut to a full view of Bolin inside the water sphere as he is slowly lifted out of the pool. Scene changes to an aerial view of the skirmish as Ming-Hua has both arms raised.)</i><br><br><b>Ming-Hua:</b> Go get the Avatar. I have these two under control.<br><br><i>(Ghazan runs off and he passes by an unconscious Mako who is laying on a pile of broken wood. A water arm reaches in and lifts Mako's body and Ming-Hua holds the brothers high up. Bolin pops his head out of the water sphere, gasping for air. <br><br>View changes to Naga running out of the Misty Palms Oasis and camera zooms in on Asami who was initially looking to the side but turns her head to the front suddenly and gasps. Naga attemps to stop running and we cut to an overhead shot of the polar bear dog stopping just short of a slab of earth in front of her. Three more slabs are bent on all sides soon after to form a pyramid, trapping Asami, Korra, and Naga inside. Asami yelps and Naga barks.<br><br>Camera cuts back into the Spirit World.)</i><br><br><b>Zaheer:</b> You know, being locked away for so many years, I was beginning to lose hope. <i>(stands up)</i> But when I awoke with airbending, I knew <i>I</i> would be the one to destroy the Old World and plant seeds for a New World to flourish.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(stands and looks concerned)</i> Zaheer, please. As an airbender, you could help make a positive difference in the world instead of destroying it.<br><b>Zaheer:</b> You're a very smart young woman, Korra. But you must realize that once change begins, it cannot be stopped, even by the Avatar.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(annoyed)</i> Enough with your philosophical mumbo jumbo. I want to know one thing. If you do capture me, what are you gonna do with me?<br><b>Zaheer:</b> You'll have that answer soon enough.

After confronting Zaheer, Korra learned he is part of a secret society whose mission is to take out all the nation's leaders and destroy World order. But before Korra could warn anyone, she and Asami were apprehended by the Earth Queen's forces. And the Red Lotus nabbed Mako and Bolin. Now both parties are headed toward Ba Sing Se.<br><br><br><br><b><u>Act I</u></b><br><br><i>(Episode opens to a building in the desert and we can see a group of people walking towards an airship. Camera cuts to ground level as two people push the dolly Korra is on while Asami walks forward with her head bowed down.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> You have to let me out! The Earth Queen is in danger from a group of terrorists calling themselves the Red Lotus! <i>(turns her attention to the captain as she is pushed up the ramp leading into the airship)</i> I talked to one of them in the Spirit World yesterday. He- he's insane.<br><b>Captain:</b> <i>(with a toothpick between his lips)</i> Screaming about terrorists in the Spirit World? You're the one who sounds insane.<br><br><i>(The middle aged captain turns and walks into his ship and the hatch closes. The airship takes off the ground soon after. Cut to a hand locking a chain from Korra's dolly to the wall. Camera pans out to Asami looking at her friend being locked up. An airman wearing a bandana then walks to Asami and grabs the girl's chains to tie her to a bar on the floor.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> Do I <i>(kneels on the ground)</i> have to be chained to the floor the whole way? <i>(looks back at Arik pitifully)</i> It's going to be <i>so</i> uncomfortable.<br><b>Arik:</b> <i>(continues to loop the chain around the bar)</i> Sorry, ma'am. I'm under orders.<br><b>Asami:</b> Can't you just <i>(looks at the railing on the wall)</i> chain me to that railing? <i>(Arik turns and looks)</i> I mean, where am I gonna go? <i>Please</i>.<br><br><i>(Asami pouts and Arik reconsiders.)</i><br><br><b>Arik:</b> Well, as long as you're chained up, I guess it doesn't make a difference.<br><br><i>(Camera pans to Asami chained to the railing against the wall.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(smiles)</i> Thank you, Sir.<br><b>Korra:</b> Can I have some water? <br><b>Arik:</b> <i>(points a finger at Korra)</i> No water. We're also not gonna bring you any rocks or fire, so don't ask. <i>(places a hand on his chin)</i> I guess there's air, but there's nothing we can do about that. We're not opening your compartment until we reach Ba Sing Se.<br><br><i>(Arik turns to leave the room.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> I hoped Mako and Bolin <i>(Arik slams the door shut off-screen)</i> would have shown up to save us by now. I wonder if they're okay.<br><br><i>(Scene changes to a truck driving along a desert road. Cut to the inside of the truck and we can see Zaheer is driving while his girlfriend is in the passenger's seat.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> If you think<i>(cut to the back of the truck where Ghazan and Ming-Hua are seated on a bench and looking at the brothers tied up together on the floor)</i> holding us hostage will give you some leverage to use against the Avatar, you're gonna be <i>very</i> disappointed.<br><b>Ming-Hua:</b> <i>(acidly)</i> Can't we just enjoy our time together in <i>silence</i>?<br><b>Mako:</b> And why did you need Korra alive back in Zaofu? You had her paralyzed, why didn't you just take her out when you had the chance?<br><b>Ghazan:</b> Look, all you need to know is that the World is about to change, for the better.<br><b>Bolin:</b> So you guys were, like, locked up for fifteen years, huh? That must have been, like, crazy boring.<br><b>Ghazan:</b> Actually, it was only thirteen years, but it felt like thirty.<br><b>Bolin:</b> I mean, what did you do with all that time? Did you sing songs, work on crafts?<br><b>Ming-Hua:</b> Not a lot of craft supplies in a <i>volcanic</i> prison cell.<br><b>Ghazan:</b> <i>(softens his expression)</i> And I must have renamed the constellations about a thousand times. When it rained, that was a big event.<br><b>Ming-Hua:</b> Oh, I would've killed for some rain. Mostly I just made up stories about the guards. <i>(her eyes glance up wistfully)</i> Who was having trouble with his girlfriend? Which one secretly wished he'd become a pastry chef?<br><b>Bolin:</b> Ooh, okay, that sounds like fun. Let me try that on you guys. <i>(glances at Ghazan)</i> You were raised by an older sister. Your mustache grew in when you were ten. And I'm sensing- just sensing- an unspoken attraction <i>(Ghazan and Ming-Hua look at each other awkwardly)</i> between you two.<br><br><i>(Ming-Hua gives Ghazan a sulking look and turns away, surprising the lavabender.)</i><br><br><b>Ghazan:</b> <i>(smiles at Bolin)</i> Two out of three. Not bad.<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(annoyed)</i> Bolin, will you stop making <i>friends</i> with the bad guys?<br><b>Bolin:</b> Sorry.<br><b>Zaheer:</b> Ghazan, gag those two. We're almost there.<br><br><i>(Cut a view of the truck approaching the outer wall of Ba Sing Se. Scene changes to the Earth Kingdom airship flying over the Si Wong Desert. Cut to Korra struggling against her dolly with all her might but the lock holds firmly.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(looks at Asami)</i> We have to find a way out of this prison before we get to the Earth Queen.<br><b>Asami:</b> Don't worry, I have a plan. These airships that Cabbage Corp sold to the Earth Kingdom are <i>way</i> cheaper than the ones Future Industries built.<br><br><i>(Asami plants both feet against the wall and pushes against it. Camera switches to a close up of the bars on the wall as Asami pulls it away with a grunt. She jumps over the bar so her hands are now in front of her instead of behind her. Asami tosses the bar in the air to get it into the right position.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(catches the railing and gives it a once over)</i> Now, that's just shoddy workmanship. <i>(walks up to Korra's dolly to inspect)</i> There's no way I can get these locks off. I need the keys. <br><br><i>(Miss Sato glances around the compartment before looking down at the floor with a smile. Using the railing as a lever, Asami pries off the metal tile from the floor and we can see pipes and light below.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(to Korra)</i> Give me five minutes, then start yelling for help.<br><br><i>(Asami bends down and puts the railing aside before crawling into the vents under the floor.

But first there are some people here who captured two of the Avatar's friends. <i>(Cut to the queen who scowls)</i> They would like to present them to you personally.<br><b>Queen Hou-Ting:</b> You know I don't meet with bounty hunters!<br><b>Gun:</b> <i>(shrugs a little)</i> And of course I told them that, but they say they have some information that might interest you about the location of your stolen airbenders.<br><b>Queen Hou-Ting:</b> Really? <i>(gives a smile of amusement)</i> Fine, send them in.<br><br><i>(Cut to the brothers gagged and tied as they are shoved on the floor in front of the throne. Switch to a close up of the queen as she glares at them.)</i><br><br><b>Queen Hou-Ting:</b> Ah, yes. I remember <i>these</i> two. <i>(view changes to the brothers and the feet of the Red Lotus members standing behind them)</i> We'll find an acceptable home for you in <i>prison</i> with the rest of the dissidents. <i>(camera pans up to a full view shot of the Red Lotus crew)</i> Now, I'm told you have some <i>information</i> for me. I hope this isn't just some <i>ruse</i> to try to increase your bounty.<br><b>Zaheer:</b> We don't want any bounty, Your Majesty. <i>(gestures an arm out to Mako and Bolin)</i> You can consider these two a <i>(smiles)</i> thank you gift for simply taking the time to talk to us.<br><b>Queen Hou-Ting:</b> <i>(a little suspicious)</i> How very magnanimous. So, where are my airbenders?<br><b>Zaheer:</b> <i>(grins)</i> I'd be happy to tell you once you hand the Avatar over to me.<br><b>Queen Hou-Ting:</b> Who told you that we have the Avatar?<br><b>Zaheer:</b> <i>(smirks)</i> How I know is not important. <i>(turns serious)</i> But if I found out, others will too. And that could put <i>you</i> in a difficult position.<br><b>Queen Hou-Ting:</b> <i>(patronizing them with a hand on her cheek)</i> Is that so?<br><b>Zaheer:</b> Your Majesty, imprisoning the Avatar will cause the other nations to turn against you and demand her freedom. Before long, you'll be in the midst of a sticky international incident. <i>(gestures to himself)</i> But if you let me take her today, no one need ever know she was here, and you can get your airbenders back without interference. We both win.<br><b>Queen Hou-Ting:</b> <i>(still being a little arrogant)</i> And what do you plan to do with the Avatar, should I see <i>fit</i> to grant your request?<br><b>Zaheer:</b> All I can say is that I have business with her. But she won't be bothering you again, <i>(Bolin and Mako look at each other worriedly)</i> I can assure you of that.<br><br><i>(Cut to the queen who ponders over the deal while tapping her long finger nails on the arm of the throne. She then sits up straight with a smile.)</i><br><br><b>Queen Hou-Ting:</b> I find these terms agreeable. Gun, escort them to the antechamber until the Avatar's arrival. <br><br><i>(Gun gestures a palm out of the throne room and the Red Lotus leaves along with him. Cut to an overhead shot of the throne room.)</i><br><br><b>Queen Hou-Ting:</b> Send these two to the dungeon.<br><br><i>(Two Dai Li agents step forth and bend the floor under the brothers as they fall through the trap door. The siblings give a muffled yell and the ground closes above them soon after. <br><br>Scene changes to the Earth Kingdom airship still flying over the sea of sand in the Si Wong Desert. Cut to Arik standing outside the door of Korra's compartment)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Guard! <i>(Arik is alarmed and slides open the viewing slot into the cell)</i> Get in here! Something happened to my friend! She needs help!<br><br><i>(Arik's eyes glance left and right. We cut to his point of view looking into a relatively empty compartment unit.)</i><br><br><b>Arik:</b> Where is she?<br><br><i>(The airman is roughly shoved against the door and he slides down comically to reveal Asami behind him in a "chopping" pose. She bends down and we cut to the inside of the compartment as the door opens inwards. Asami no longer has chains on her wrists and she twirls the keys around her finger repeatedly in a circle. Cut to the ground as the straightjacket falls on it in a heap. Camera pans up to a freed Korra.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Nice work. <i>(removes the muzzle)</i> Now let's take control of this ship.<br><br><i>(She tosses the muzzle aside and scene changes to the cockpit where the captain relaxes with his feet on the dashboard while his co-pilot is at the steering wheel. Korra kicks the door open and the co-pilot rushes towards her but he is knocked back into the steering wheel with airbending. The wheel sparks as it is damaged from the impact. View changes to the outside as the airship shakes from the lost of control.)</i><br><br><b>Captain:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> Mayday, mayday! <i>(cut to the captain talking into the radio as his co-pilot struggles to stand up)</i> The Avatar has escaped. <i>(the alarms buzz and flash red)</i> We're going down in Quadrant Four of the Si Wong Desert.<br><br><i>(The co-pilot runs towards Korra again and she unleashes another attack which slams the co-pilot back into his captain. We can see bits of the radio flying as well. Asami steps in and grabs the steering wheel.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> I think you might have been a little <i>(tugs the wheel back into position)</i> overaggressive with the airbending. <i>(cut to a frontal shot of Asami who looks a little distressed and Korra appears concerned behind her)</i> The controls are busted. <i>(she picks up the radio that is broken into two and are connected by frayed wires)</i> Also, you broke the radio.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(defensive)</i> Sorry, but it's not my fault this airship's a hunk of junk.<br><br><i>(View changes to the outside as the airship slowly descends.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> Hang on to something!<br><br><i>(The airship angles downwards and crashes into a sand dune. Cut to an overhead view of the accident as a cloud of smoke is emitted from the airship before everything is still. Cut to commercial break.)</i><br><br><br><br><b><u>Act II</u></b><br><br><i>(Episode returns to the airship crash site. Cut to a close up of the ship as the hatch on the roof opens to reveal Korra and Asami. Both of them look out into the desert.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> Well, they say any landing you can walk away from is a good landing. But given our location, <i>(a small breeze blows by them)</i> I'm not so sure about that.<br><b>Korra:</b> You're the engineer, <i>(camera pans to the busted propeller of the airship)</i> what do you think? Can we get it flying again?<br><b>Asami:</b> It doesn't look good. I mean, even if you metalbend the propellers back into shape, <i>(Arik, Kong, and the co-pilot climb out of the hatch)</i> we'd have to dig this whole thing out of the sand.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(to the men)</i> Is everyone all right?<br><b>Arik:</b> <i>(has a hand on his head)</i> Like you care.<br><b>Kong:</b> What the heck happened?<br><b>Arik:</b> <i>(points an accusatory finger at Korra)</i> She said her friend needed help. Then they knocked me out!<br><b>Korra:</b> I'm sorry, but I couldn't let you take me to the Earth Queen as a captive. There are dangerous forces at work that you don't know anything about.<br><b>Kong:</b> <i>(worriedly)</i> More dangerous than being stranded in the desert?<br><b>Captain:</b> <i>(climbs out of the hatch)</i> Don't worry, Kong. <i>(walks towards his crew with his hands in his pockets)</i> I radioed Ba Sing Se before we went down. We just need to sit tight. Someone will be here soon to rescue us.<br><b>Korra:</b> I'm not waiting around for that. We need to get out of here now.<br><b>Asami:</b> If we all work together, we might be able to get the ship up and running.<br><b>Kong:</b> Not likely.

Not even <i>(leaves a gap between his thumb and pointer finger)</i> a little.<br><b>Mako:</b> You've always had the ability deep down. You just haven't had the right motivation. But <i>(points at his brother)</i> this is your time.

Cut to an overhead shot of two abandoned jeeps that belong to Aiwei and Team Avatar. Lin pulls up, stops her car, and gets out to inspect the team's vehicle. She is about to search the back seat when a flash of white jumps at Lin and we cut to Naga as she snarls at the Chief who yells with surprise.

The vehicle looks decent and worthy of flying. Someone is welding at the back of the ship. The door leading to the ship opens and two people walk out.

They turn and run off with the rest of the airmen. Cut to a frontal shot of the group as they flee and we can see the monster leaping up behind them. They are soon knocked over by a wave of sand.

All we need is a sail and some kind of sled to attach it to.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(turns to the captain)</i> It's worth a try.<br><b>Captain:</b> <i>(to his crew)</i> Gather every piece of metal you can find.

Now, can you help me?<br><br><i>(The engineer nods and Ming-Hua tosses him into the chair at the control desk. He stands up, turns the dial on a machine in front of him, and ducks under the microphone to allow Zaheer to sit down in the chair.)</i><br><br><b>Zaheer:</b> <i>(speaks into the microphone)</i> Attention, citizens of Ba Sing Se. I have an important announcement to make. <i>(cut to a rich family of three looking to the radio)</i> Moments ago, the Earth Queen was brought down <i>(scene changes to Yin and her family as they gasp with shock. Yin has a hand on her mouth.)</i> at the hands of revolutionaries, including myself. I'm not going to tell you my name, <i>(cut to an overhead view of the Lower Ring with its citizens looking up at the speakers mounted on tall poles)</i> 'cause my identity's not important. I'm not here to take over the Earth Kingdom. <i>(view changes to Mako and Bolin in their prison cell hearing the announcement with surprise)</i> I think you've had enough of leaders telling you what to do. <i>(camera cuts back to Zaheer in the communications room)</i> It's time for you to find your own path. No longer will you be oppressed by tyrants. <i>(cut to an overhead shot of the wall separating the Upper Ring from the Middle Ring)</i> From now on, <i>(camera cuts to Ghazan on the ground)</i> you are free.

View changes back to the side view shot as we can see fire coming out of the monster's gills and the sand sailer rushes out of its mouth. The shark fall back down into the sand, hurt, and creates a tsunami wave comprising of sand. The vehicle returns back to the ground as it rides on top of the wave that helps them push forth and escape to freedom.<br><br>Camera fades to an aerial view of the Misty Palms Oasis as the sand sailer makes its way to the walls of the town. We can see a red dragon laying on the sand outside the wall. Cut to a close up of the makeshift sand sailer as it parks beside a group of sandbenders on their own proper sailer. Korra stops airbending and the mast breaks, causing it and the flag to fall. The sandbenders look on with quiet amusement.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(humors)</i> You want to buy a slightly used sand-sailer?<br><br><i>(Everyone disembarks from the vehicle onto the wooden docks.)</i><br><br><b>Captain:</b> Thanks, Asami.

View changes to another looter grabbing a vertical scenic painting of mountains and trees. Cut to Mako and Bolin walking out of the palace entrance as looters rush in. Bolin looks around in shock.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(looks around)</i> I can't believe it. The Upper Ring is in chaos.<br><br><i>(Switch to a trio of looters confronting a royal palace guard who is armed with a spear.)</i><br><br><b>Looter:</b> <i>(points at the guard)</i> Don't try to stop us. We're taking back what's ours.<br><b>Royal Guard:</b> Stop you? <i>(pulls off his hat)</i> I'm gonna join you. <i>(smiles)</i> I know where the <i>good</i> stuff is. <br><br><i>(The guard points his spear towards the inside of the palace and runs off. The looters follow him. Cut Bolin who steps back to allow a looter with a vase on his head and a small bench in hand to pass.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Should we do something? <i>(Another looter passes behind Bolin, carrying a changing screen.)</i><br><b>Mako:</b> This isn't our battle. <i>(walks off-screen)</i> We have to deliver Zaheer's message to Korra immediately.<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(follows Mako)</i> Right. Okay. Find Korra, deliver message. <i>(Cut to an overhead view of the brothers and more looters rush up the stairs leading into the palace. We can see a more airships taking off in the background.)</i> Yeah, this should be easy. We just gotta get out of the city and get to the desert, then somehow find her in the vast, expansive wasteland <i>(Switch to a close up of the brothers as Mako scans the sky while Bolin slowly grows defeated)</i> that goes on for thousands and thousands of miles. <i>(sighs)</i> This isn't gonna be easy.<br><br><i>(View focuses on an airborne airship and we cut back to Mako.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> We need an airship.<br><br><i>(Scene changes to one lone airship left on the ground as the looters continue to head to the palace. View switches to the inside of the airship as Mako runs into it. Mako raises a hand up and Bolin runs smack into his brother's hand.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Ooh!<br><br><i>(Both of them look into the inside of the ship with mild surprise. Camera pans out to reveal four looters tinkering with the airship parts.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Excuse me, <i>(the looters turn to look at Mako)</i> may I have your attention please? I'm with the Republic City Police, and I need to commandeer this airship to help the <i>Avatar</i>.<br><br><i>(One of the looters peels off a panel from the the wall. Everyone ignores Mako and continues to raid the ship. Cut to a dismayed Mako while his brother quietly stares at the looters.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Let me give it a shot. Hey, the Queen's gold <i>(points out)</i> is on the third floor of the palace! <i>(the looters stop and smile)</i> Second door on the right! <br><br><i>(The raiders leave and Mako smiles at his brother.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(arms akimbo and feeling accomplished)</i> You just gotta know how to talk to them, bro.<br><br><i>(The brothers run to the controls and Bolin sits down in the pilot's chair. Mako is alarmed by the property damage.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> They took everything. <i>(picks up a couple of frayed wires)</i> I mean, who rips out a transmission radio?<br><b>Bolin:</b> Some folks just do not <i>(Mako throws the wires down angrily)</i> have respect For other people's property. <i>(cracks his fingers)</i> Now let's steal this airship! <i>(Bolin sticks a tongue out of his mouth and lands both hands on two different levers)</i><br><b>Mako:</b> You know how to fly this thing?<br><b>Bolin:</b> Technically speaking? No. But, come on, how hard can it be? <br><br><i>(A piece of broken glass pops out from its socket. Bolin pushes a lever forward and we immediately cut to the outside where the airship barrels down and scraps along the ground. The civilians begin to panic and they start to run away.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> Up! Up!<br><b>Bolin:</b> I don't see any "up" button. I see levers and switches. Oh, <i>(the airship begins to pull up)</i> there it is.<br><br><i>(The airship finally takes off and scene fades to fires ravaging the Lower Ring of Ba Sing Se. Through the smoke, we can see the brothers' airship slowly making its way out. Cut to an overhead view of some citizens looking at an apartment complex burn down. Cut to Mako looking down from the window. Ash and ember float upwards and surround the airship.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> The whole city is falling to pieces.<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(glances at his brother worriedly)</i> Mako, our family's down there.<br><br><i>(View changes to Bolin at the pilot's seat and Mako shoves him away, taking over the controls.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Move over. <br><b>Bolin:</b> Ahh!<br><b>Mako:</b> We're getting them out.<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(sits up)</i> Oh, you think <i>(Mako adjusts a knob off to the side)</i> just because you dated Asami, you know how to fly this better than me?<br><b>Mako:</b> Yeah.<br><br><i>(Mako tugs on a lever and we cut to the airship speedily making its way to Yin's apartment and the surrounding buildings are covered in flames. Cut to Bolin who lands on the roof and then slides down a ladder. Cut to the inside of a window as Bolin pops his head in.)</i><br><br><b>Chow:</b> Bolin? <i>(Camera pans out to Yin's family gathered in the living room and the relatives turn to look at the earthbender)</i> What are <i>(stands up)</i> you doing here?<br><br><i>(Bolin climbs in through the window.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> I came to get you guys out. This whole block is about to go up in flames. <i>(Cut to a frontal shot of Bolin as he waves his hand towards the window and we can see Tu, his grandmother and some relatives seated on the ground.)</i> Come on, Mako and I have an airship on the roof. <i>(Bolin starts to move away)</i><br><b>Tu:</b> We can't. <i>(Bolin stops in his tracks and turns around to look at his cousin)</i> Grandma won't go.<br><b>Yin:</b> <i>(Cut to a close up of a stubborn Yin)</i> This place is my whole world. <i>(slams a fist down on her lap)</i> I will not leave. <i>(softens her expression)</i> Oh, but I'm so glad <i>(stands up and loops her arms around Bolin's elbow)</i> my little Bolin has come back to visit. Sit down. <i>(tugs her grandson forward but Bolin resists)</i> Would you like some tea?<br><b>Bolin:</b> Grandma, <i>(grabs Yin by the shoulders)</i> we don't have time for tea.<br><br><i>(Everyone turns to look at the flames licking the entrance to the apartment and the outline of the doors glow red hot.)</i><br><br><b>Chow:</b> Mom, please.<br><b>Yin:</b> <i>(looks at her son and waves both fists down)</i> No! I can't abandon the place where I raised my family. <i>(turns back to look at Bolin)</i> It's my home.<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(holds Yin's hands and speaks gently)</i> Grandma, there's one thing that Mako and I have learned from all our years on the street. <i>(Cut to a close up of Yin with tears shining in her eyes)</i> It doesn't matter where you go. If you have your family with you, you'll always be at home.<br><b>Yin:</b> <i>(closes her eyes and speaks stubbornly)</i> I'm not going.<br><b>Bolin:</b> Fine! <i>(hoists Yin onto his shoulder)</i> You leave me no choice. <i>(gestures to the window)</i> We're rolling out!<br><b>Yin:</b> <i>(gasps)</i> Wait. <i>(view changes to the Earth Queen's portrait and Yin takes it in her hands)</i> Okay, let's go.<br><br><i>(View changes to the roof as the family climbs up the ladder and into the airship. Switch to the inside of the apartment complex as it is completed consumed by the inferno. An explosion occurs and glass breaks. The airship sails above the apartment to safety. Cut to a slight aerial view of the Lower Ring as the fire starts to spread. The airship flies into frame and continues to move forward. Scene cuts back to the inside of the airship with Bolin at the controls and Mako along with Tu standing behind him.)</i><br><br><b>Tu:</b> Thanks for getting us out of there. <i>(Tu starts to brag and Mako crosses his arms and raises an eyebrow.)</i> I mean, I probably could have handled it myself if you guys didn't show up, but thanks.<br><br><i>(The brothers smile and we cut to a close up of Yin hanging the Earth Queen's picture on a wall of the airship.)</i><br><br><b>Yin:</b> <i>(kisses at the portrait with her hands and puts them in a praying gesture)</i> May she rest in peace. <i>(Mako walks into frame with a map in hand and Yin turns towards him.)</i> This airship is nice. Is it our new home?<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(rests a hand on Yin's shoulder)</i> No, Grandma, I'm not sure where we're gonna take you. But right now, we need to find Korra.<br><b>Chow:</b> <i>(walks in)</i> Did something happen to the Avatar?<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(grabs the map)</i> I'm afraid so. <i>(Cut to a close up of the map being rolled open to reveal a map of the Earth Kingdom and its military bases)</i> Her airship went down somewhere in the desert. <i>(points to the desert on the map)</i> She was coming from a military base near the Misty Palms Oasis and heading <i>(points to the walled city on the map)</i> to Ba Sing Se. <i>(Cut to a full view of all the relatives listening to Mako's plan)</i> If we retrace her route back to the base, we should find the wreckage.<br><br><i>(Location changes to the Si Wong Desert shrouded in darkness but the Sun rises, illuminating its rays on the sand. Camera fades to a view of all the relatives gathered on both sides of the ship, looking out the window. Camera fades to a pregnant relative with a hand on her belly looking out the window and we can see her reflection in the glass. She looks a little despondent. Camera fades again to the outside of the ship looking in and we see the relatives at the windows slowly growing tired. A young girl yawns. Tu has a telescope in hand. Camera fades to the children sleeping either on the floor or in their mother's lap. Cut back to Tu still looking through the spyglass.)</i><br><br><b>Tu:</b> Guys, <i>(an older man beside him stirs)</i> it's the wreckage! <i>(Cut to Mako at the controls and he along with Bolin turn their attention to Tu)</i> I found it. <i>(switch to an over the shoulder shot of Tu as he points to ruins in the distance)</i> There.<br><br><i>(Cut to the shambles on the ground as the airship hovers above it)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> That's a Ba Sing Se airship, all right. But where's the rest of it? <br><br><i>(View changes to the brothers and Tu at the window.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> I don't know, <i>(points out and camera cuts to an aerial view of the wreckage)</i> but there are some tracks. <br><br><i>(Camera pans out to a winding curvy trail of the sandsailer's route from the previous episode. The airship follows and scene changes to Zuko's dragon sleeping outside the Misty Palms Oasis. It lifts its head up suddenly and beats its wings, flying off the ground with a roar. The airship roughly lands at the spot the dragon was on. Cut to an aerial view of the village as the airship creaks. We can see that Zuko's mount has perched itself on the walls of the Misty Palms Oasis. View changes to the controls of the airship. Mako's hair is messy, Bolin is splayed out on the control panel while Tu is on the floor rubbing his head.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> See? I told you, landing is hard.<br><br><i>(Mako looks at Bolin tiredly. Scene switches to a fish spirit flying down to the ice fountain and we see a myriad of spirits playing in the frozen water. The brothers walk in followed by their extended family.)</i><br><br><b>Female Relative:</b> <i>(gasps in awe)</i> Spirits!<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(jumps and stands on the side of the fountain to address his relatives)</i> Okay, guys, we think Korra found her way back here. <i>(Pabu squeaks and climbs up Bolin's legs)</i> Now let's split off into teams and scour the town. <i>(Pabu perches on Bolin's shoulder and he notices)</i> Yes, we'll need your help too, Pabu. <i>(Cut to a close up of Bolin)</i> Now just give me a second while I- <i>(gasps as he takes a look at Pabu once more)</i> Wait. <i>(grabs his fire ferret with both hands)</i> Pabu? <i>(he has tears in his eyes)</i> Pabu!<br><br><i>(Bolin swings his pet in the air for a short while before hugging the creature close to his body and yelling with joy. Pabu squeaks happily. Cut to a close up of Yin and Chow looking at Bolin with disbelief.)</i><br><br><b>Yin:</b> <i>(whispers to her son)</i> Why is Bolin hugging that big rat? <i>(Chow shakes his head and Yin puts both hands on her mouth)</i> Ew. <i>(turns away)</i> Now he's kissing it.<br><br><i>(Cut to Bolin kissing Pabu's snout.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> I'm never gonna let you go again.<br><br><i>(Cut to Tu pointing off-screen in alarm)</i><br><br><b>Tu:</b> Guys, look out! <i>(rushing footsteps can be heard)</i> Giant dog-beast thingy!<br><br><i>(The relatives disperse, leaving Mako alone as he turns to the side with his eyes wide open. Switch to an side view shot of Mako as Naga pounces on him, throwing the firebender down on the ground. The polar bear-dog licks Mako happily.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(puts both hands up in an attempt to stop Naga's licking)</i> Okay, all right, Naga. <i>(Bolin runs up to his brother)</i> It's good to see you too. <i>(Cut to a close up of Mako's face as Naga licks all of it)</i> Ahh, stop. <i>(turns to the side and Naga licks Mako's ear)</i> You're licking my mouth.<br><br><i>(Naga finally stops and Mako sits up, coughing and wiping his lips against the back of his glove.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> Asami! Korra! <br><br><i>(Mako looks up with surprise. View switches to both girls running out from an establishment.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> You guys are okay! <br><br><i>(Mako pushes himself off the ground and both brothers rush up to them. Bolin hugs Asami and lifts her off the ground while Mako embraces Korra with a wide smile on his face. Korra is stunned for a second before placing a hand on his back to return the hug.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(awkwardly pulls away)</i> Sorry, <i>(nervously)</i> I was just- <i>(Korra continues to smile up at Mako)</i> It's so good to see you.<br><b>Korra:</b> It's really good to see you too, <i>(Bolin walks up to Korra and she turns to her friend)</i> both of you.<br><b>Lin:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> Good. <i>(The teens turn their attention towards the voice and we cut to the adults stepping out of the tavern)</i> You guys aren't dead.<br><b>Mako:</b> Don't get all mushy on me, Chief. <i>(bows)</i> Tonraq, sir.<br><br><i>(Cut to Tonraq who gives a nod of acknowledgement. Bolin comically slides in and gawks at Zuko with admiration. Zuko and Lin look at the earthbender's antics.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Oh, my gosh. <i>(whispers to Mako behind him)</i> It's Lord Zuko. <i>(starts to squee)</i> I can't believe it.<br><br><i>(Bolin whimpers and flails about as he tries to reach out to touch Zuko but stops himself. Mako pulls his brother back.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Uh, forgive my brother. <i>(bows to Zuko)</i> We're just really honored <i>(Bolin bows as well)</i> to meet you, sir.<br><b>Lord Zuko:</b> <i>(returns the bow)</i> It's a pleasure to meet you as well.<br><br><i>(Cut to Asami looking on and Yin walks in and takes Asami's hands in her grasp.)</i><br><br><b>Yin:</b> You must be the Avatar. <i>(Asami smiles nervously)</i> Mako told me so much about you. <i>(Asami cringes a bit but maintains the smile)</i> You are even more beautiful than I imagined. <i>(Mako walks to his grandmother with Korra beside him and Asami looks up.)</i><br><b>Mako:</b> Uh, actually, <i>(Asami gives another nervous grin)</i> that's Asami. <i>(he gestures to Korra)</i> This is Avatar Korra. <i>(Yin releases her hold on Asami and turns to the Avatar)</i> Korra, this is my Grandma, Yin.<br><br><i>(Korra extends a hand out for a handshake but Yin holds Korra's arm with both hands and examines them.)</i><br><br><b>Yin:</b> You are very... muscular for a woman. <i>(smiles)</i><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(awkwardly)</i> Um, thanks. You too?<br><br><i>(Yin holds Korra and Asami in each hand.)</i><br><br><b>Yin:</b> What lovely young women. <i>(Korra smiles at Yin)</i> Mako, why aren't you dating any nice girls <i>(all three teens widen their eyes in shock)</i> like them?<br><br><i>(There is a brief silence as Korra and Asami smirk while Mako still looks apprehensive.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(breaks the silence)</i> Uh... so what happened to you two? Where have you been?<br><b>Mako:</b> We were captured by Zaheer and taken to Ba Sing Se. <i>(turns to Korra)</i> We were there when the Earth Queen was overthrown.<br><b>Korra:</b> What? <i>(turns to Bolin as he walks in)</i> How did you escape?<br><b>Mako:</b> Zaheer let us go.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(glances at Bolin)</i> Why would he do that?<br><b>Bolin:</b> Because he wanted us to find you and deliver a message.<br><br><i>(Cut to a close up of a concerned Mako.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Zaheer is headed to the Northern Air Temple as we speak. He said he's gonna wipe out the new Air Nation and everyone in it, unless you turn yourself over to him.<br><br><i>(Camera switches to a profile shot of Korra as she widens her eyes with horror. Cut to commercial break.)</i><br><br><br><br><b><u>Act II</u></b> <br><br><i>(Episode returns to Team Avatar and the adults gathered around in a circle.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(sadly)</i> Zaheer's threatening innocent lives, just to get to me.<br><b>Tonraq:</b> He <i>(Lin, Bolin, and Mako turn towards him)</i> could be bluffing. <br><b>Mako:</b> He's <i>(Lin & Bolin turn to the firebender)</i> already taken out the Earth Queen. I don't think he bluffs.<br><b>Korra:</b> We need to radio Tenzin and warn him that the Red Lotus is coming.<br><b>Mako:</b> I agree. Unfortunately, We don't have a radio on the airship.<br><b>Tonraq:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> There's a portable radio in the jeep, <i>(cut to an overhead shot of the whole group)</i> but the signal will never make it to the Northern Air Temple.<br><b>Lin:</b> We need to get to a place that has a strong radio transmitter. The Metal Clan will have one.<br><b>Korra:</b> Let's go. We'll radio Su on the way. <i>(looks down)</i> Hopefully she can get ahold of Tenzin at the air temple by the time we get to Zaofu.<br><br><i>(Location changes to the airship and Zuko's dragon flying towards the docking platform in Zaofu. View changes to the docking bay itself as Su waits for everyone to disembark from the airship. Cut to a close up profile shot of Su with her hands clapsed together and looking worried.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Did you <i>(camera pulls out a bit as Korra, Tonraq, and Lin walk up to the matriach)</i> have any luck getting through to Tenzin?<br><b>Su:</b> <i>(frowns slightly)</i> No one's answering. <i>(perturbed and hunches over slightly)</i> What if Zaheer is already up there? I should never have let Opal go.<br><b>Lin:</b> <i>(walks up to her sister and rests a hand on Su's shoulder)</i> It's going to be okay, Su.<br><b>Su:</b> I hope so.<br><br><i>(Cut to a hand adjusting a couple of dials on the radio. There is some static followed by silence on the other end of the radio. Camera changes angles to a frontal shot of the radio operator looking back at Korra.)</i><br><br><b>Radio Operator:</b> We have a strong signal, but no one's answering.<br><b>Korra:</b> I can't just sit around here while a madman is on his way to the Northern Air Temple. We have to do something! <br><b>Su:</b> I'll ready my airship. <i>(determined)</i> With the full force of the Metal Clan Security backing us, we can take them. <i>(Su turns and walks out of the radio room)</i><br><b>Mako:</b> We'll never make it up there before Zaheer.<br><b>Korra:</b> There might be another way to stop him. It's a long shot, but Zaheer is always meditating into the Spirit World, and I know exactly where he goes. Xai Bau's Grove. If I could find him there, maybe I could somehow trap him.<br><b>Lin:</b> We can't protect you in there. I don't like it.<br><b>Korra:</b> I'll be fine. I have to try.<br><b>Asami:</b> I'll watch over her as she meditates.<br><b>Bolin:</b> I guess in the meantime, Mako and I will stay here and try to get through to the temple.<br><b>Tonraq:</b> We'll help Su ready the airship. <br><br><i>(Tonraq, Asami, and Korra turn to exit the room. As they leave, Yin is revealed to be in the background, looking out of a window. View changes to the window outside looking in at Yin.)</i><br><br><b>Yin:</b> I'm going to take a nap.<br><br><i>(Yin walks away too. Scene changes to Korra seated in the lotus position in front of a small tree. Asami sits on her knees beside her friend. Calming, spiritual music plays as the camera slowly zooms in on both girls. Cut to a close up of Korra's face with her eyes closed and the camera slowly fades away to her in the Spirit World. Korra opens her eyes and camera zooms out to reveal Korra standing under the rain tree at Xai Bau's Grove. The area around the tree is surrounded by thick white fog.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(looks around)</i> Zaheer, come out! <i>(camera zooms out slightly to show Korra alone at the grove)</i> Face me! Leave the airbenders out of this. <br><br><i>(Cut to Korra again as she first looks angry, then dismayed, and followed shortly by mild surprise as a shadow appears behind her beyond the fog. She turns towards the approaching person.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> There you are.<br><br><i>(Camera switches to a close up of the bulky figure as it contiues to walk forward.)</i><br><br><b>Uncle Iroh:</b> Please don't hurt me, <i>(Iroh breaks through the mist and we can see his face clearly)</i> Korra. I'm just an old man.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(amazed)</i> Iroh? What are you doing here?<br><b>Uncle Iroh:</b> <i>(walks up to the Avatar)</i> I was just out searching for a new teapot to add to my collection, but instead I found you. <i>(opens his arms wide and chuckles heartily)</i> In the Spirit World, you always seem to find something you didn't know you were looking for. <br><br><i>(Iroh smiles and camera switches to Korra who returns the smile briefly before looking depressed. Cut back to Iroh who is concerned.)</i> <br><br><b>Uncle Iroh:</b> You look troubled.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(avoiding his gaze)</i> I am. <br><b>Uncle Iroh:</b> Sit. <i>(both of them sit cross legged on the grass)</i> What is on your mind?<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(frowns)</i> There's a maniac on the loose, <i>(Iroh listens intently)</i> and he's threatening to destroy the new Air Nation. I don't know what to do. <i>(looks to the ground helplessly)</i><br><b>Uncle Iroh:</b> Just because you are the Avatar doesn't mean you will have all the answers.<br><b>Korra:</b> I know many Avatars have needed guidance, but I'm the only one since Avatar Wan that can't get help from my past lives. I wish I could talk to Aang.<br><b>Uncle Iroh:</b> <i>(touches his beard)</i> You know, Zuko and Aang were close friends.<br><b>Korra:</b> Lord Zuko, of course.<br><b>Uncle Iroh:</b> Yes, my nephew. Their relationship started off <i>(closes one eye and waves one hand around from side to side in a so-so gesture)</i> a little rocky, <i>(puts his hand down and opens his eye)</i> but they grew to become lifelong friends. <i>(smiles wistfully)</i> Best friends.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(looks at Iroh with realization)</i> Thank you. Thank you so much. You're right about the Spirit World. <i>(smiles wistfully at Iroh)</i> I came here looking for someone else, but I'm glad I found you.<br><br><i>(Iroh looks at Korra fondly as she slowly fades away. Cut back to the physical world as Korra stirs, catching Asami's attention.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> Did you find Zaheer? <br><b>Korra:</b> No, he wasn't there. But there's someone I need to talk to.<br><br><i>(Scene changes to Zuko strapping his bag to his dragon as Korra walks up to him.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> You're leaving? <i>(Zuko tugs on the straps)</i> Aren't you coming to the air temple with us?<br><b>Lord Zuko:</b> I'm sorry, <i>(stops his movement)</i> but I can't. I'm going back to the Fire Nation. If it's true that the Red Lotus is targeting the Nation's leaders, I need to protect my daughter.<br><b>Korra:</b> I understand, you have to keep the Fire Lord safe. But before you leave, I was wondering if you could help me with something.<br><b>Lord Zuko:</b> I was often Aang's council, <i>(turns to Korra and gives her a smile)</i> and I'd love to be yours.<br><b>Korra:</b> That's just it, you knew Aang better than anyone. I was wondering if you knew what he might do if he were in my situation.<br><b>Lord Zuko:</b> <i>(places a hand on his chin and closes his eyes)</i> Hmm, rebuilding the Air Nation was Aang's biggest dream. <i>(opens his eyes and pulls his fingers away from his beard slightly)</i> He would be beside himself with joy with what you've done, and if he accomplished that goal, he  might have sacrificed <i>anything</i> to protect it.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(dismayed)</i> So he would give himself up to save the Air Nation?<br><b>Lord Zuko:</b> I don't know for sure. The airbenders might have been closest to Aang's heart, but as the Avatar, he was concerned with people of <i>all</i> nations. No one knew better than Aang that in times of turmoil, <i>(places a hand on Korra's shoulder)</i> the World needs its Avatar the most.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(smiles)</i> Thanks. <i>(Zuko removes his hand from Korra's shoulder)</i> Your uncle was right. It was helpful talking to you.<br><b>Lord Zuko:</b> <i>(mild surprise)</i> Wait, <i>(speaks quietly)</i> you spoke with my uncle?<br><b>Korra:</b> Yes, in the Spirit World. A couple of times actually.<br><br><i>(Cut to a close up of Zuko with his eyes wide open in bewilderment.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> Guys, <i>(camera pans out to Mako who runs up to Korra and Zuko)</i> we got through to the air temple!<br><br><i>(The three of them run off. Scene changes to Bolin looking frustrated in front of the radio with a hand on his head. Korra, Mako, and Zuko enter the room behind the earthbender.)</i><br><br><b>Meelo:</b> <i>(off-screen, over the radio)</i> Who is this?<br><b>Bolin:</b> I told you, <i>(grabs the microphone irritably)</i> it's Bolin!<br><b>Meelo:</b> Bolin's not here <i>(a frame of Meelo slides into view and occupies half the screen)</i> right now, <i>(digs his nose)</i> can I take a message? <i>(pulls out the booger and wipes it under the table)</i><br><b>Bolin:</b> No, I'm not looking for Bolin, <i>(Meelo looks bored)</i> I am Bolin! Ahh, look, I need you to find your dad.<br><b>Meelo:</b> He's outside with the bison. <i>(exicted)</i> Did you know we found a whole herd full of baby bison?<br><b>Bolin:</b> No. A whole herd, really?<br><br><i>(Korra shoves Bolin away roughly and grabs the microphone)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Meelo, this is your commanding officer. Go get your dad, now.<br><b>Meelo:</b> <i>(salutes)</i> Yes, sir. <br><br><i>(Meelo leaves the room and we cut to Korra as she occupies the whole frame.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Come on. Come on.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(off-screen, over the radio)</i> Hello, <i>(Korra smiles with relief)</i> this is Tenzin.<br><b>Korra:</b> Tenzin, listen to me carefully.

Leave now!<br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(over the radio)</i> Oh, no. <br><b>Korra:</b> What? <i>(Cut to Tenzin with his jaw slightly agape as he looks out the window)</i> What is it? <i>(the whirring of propellers can be heard)</i> Tenzin! Tenzin, what's happening?<br><b>Tenzin:</b> It's too late. <i>(View changes to the window looking out as the Red Lotus stand at the entrance of their airship)</i> He's here.<br><br><i>(Cut to a close up of Zaheer with his glider in hand as he stares down at the air temple. His girlfriend, P'li, can be seen behind him. Cut to commercial break.)</i><br><br><br><br><b><u>Act III</u></b><br><br><i>(Episode returns to a scenic shot of the Northern Air Temple. Tense music plays as Zaheer's airship slowly pulls in towards the temple. Cut to Meelo and Tenzin looking out of the window of the radio room as the airship passes by.)</i><br><br><b>Meelo:</b> <i>(glances at Tenzin)</i> What is it, Daddy?<br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(looks at his son)</i> We need to get everyone out of here. <i>(picks up his glider staff leaning against the window)</i> Stay close to me.<br><br><i>(View changes to the outside of the window as Tenzin and Meelo open their gliders and fly out. Scene changes to a courtyard as the airship casts a shadow on it when it passes by. Tenzin and his son can be seen heading towards the courtyard. Cut to a close up of the people in the courtyard with prominent members like Bumi and Kai looking up at the airship. Tenzin lands, catching Bumi's attention.)</i><br><br><b>Bumi:</b> What's going on, Tenzin?<br><b>Tenzin:</b> It's Zaheer. Round everyone up. We need to get to the bison and evacuate immediately.<br><br><i>(Everyone runs off. Scene changes to the pole balancing course as Daw and another airbender practice circle walking in front of the poles while the other airbenders spectate. Kai runs in.)</i><br><br><b>Kai:</b> Guys, we got an emergency. We're evacuating the temple. <i>(waves a hand)</i> Come on.<br><br><i>(They start to run off but before they can leave, the ground in front of them suddenly turns into lava.)</i><br><br><b>Kai:</b> Look out!<br><br><i>(The airbenders propel themselves backwards, away from harm. Kai and the others look up at the roof and we can see Ghazan studying them from his vantage point.<br><br>Location changes to a group of female airbenders, including Opal and Kya, meditating in a room. The door opens and they look towards it. Cut to Bumi who appears a little anxious.)</i><br><br><b>Bumi:</b> It's Zaheer. We have to leave.<br><br><i>(Scene changes to a walkway outside as Kya and her brother run off with the airbenders. A female screams loudly off-screen as the sound of water is heard. Everyone turns around and view changes to Ming-Hua who has Opal coiled up in one water arm while her other water arm is now an ice scythe.)</i><br><br><b>Ming-Hua:</b> No one's going anywhere, <i>(Cut to a close up of Ming-Hua as she slowly brings the scythe close to Opal who is terrified)</i> or she gets it.<br><br><i>(Cut to Tenzin and his family running along a corridor. As they make their way to the walkway outside, Tenzin stops and Zaheer folds his glider staff and lands in front of him.)</i><br><br><b>Zaheer:</b> Good, the entire family is here. <br><br><i>(Zaheer gives an evil smirk and we cut to Tenzin with an arm out, shielding his family. Scene changes to a satellite building seen in "The Northern Air Temple" episode on ATLA. Cut to the courtyard inside of the building as everyone is huddled on the ground in front of Zaheer and Ming-Hua. Ghazan walks in and shoves Kai towards his fellow airbenders. Cut to a frontal shot of the airbenders with Tenzin's family right in front and Pema clutches Rohan tightly while Tenzin has his arms around his wife. Kya can be seen hugging Opal at the back.)</i><br><br><b>Zaheer:</b> <i>(steps up)</i> It's a pleasure to finally meet a true airbending master.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> What is it you want from us?<br><b>Zaheer:</b> Nothing at all. In fact, if everyone cooperates, you will all walk out of this situation unharmed.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> Then what are you doing here?<br><b>Zaheer:</b> I want Korra, <i>(view pans out to show Ming-Hua and Ghazan in bending stances)</i> and I'm tired of chasing her.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> You're using us as leverage? <br><b>Zaheer:</b> Yes.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(stands up)</i> I will <i>never</i> let you get to Korra.<br><b>Zaheer:</b> <i>(darkly)</i> Unfortunately, you don't have a choice.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(seriously)</i> Yes, I do.<br><br><i>(Tenzin thrusts both his palms out and airbends the three Red Lotus members as they slam into the wall behind them. Cut back to Tenzin.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Jinora, get everyone out of here! Bumi, Kya, help me hold them off. <br><br><i>(P'li's combustion bending can be heard and Tenzin bends a protective arc of air in front of him as he jumps back. P'li's attack lands on the spot where he was just standing on. Cut to Tenzin who bends the resulting smoke away and he gazes up at the airship. Camera switches to P'li standing at the doorway of the airship and we return back to Tenzin with the airbenders standing behind him.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(points to the airship)</i> And stay out of her line of sight. Go. <i>(Zaheer and the others can be seen getting up in the background)</i> Go!<br><br><i>(The airbenders run off, leaving Tenzin and his siblings behind. Cut back to P'li as she unleashes another attack and view switches back to the ground as the airbenders retreat with Kai being the last one. He jumps up to avoid P'li's charge which hits the ground. She sends another blast even when the airbenders have cleared the area.<br><br>View changes to Ghazan, Ming-Hua, and Zaheer who have recovered from Tenzin's air attack. Cut to an overhead shot of the airship as it pulls away from the courtyard, revealing the Red Lotus members walking towards Aang's children who stand their ground. Cut to a close up of the siblings as Kya pulls a stream of water from the nearby fountain and she along with her brothers get into defensive stances. Switch to the Red Lotus members as Ghazan gets into a horse stance, Ming-Hua bends her water arms while Zaheer twirls his staff.<br><br>Location changes to Kai and the other airbenders taking refuge at the end of a sheltered corridor leading to the bison stables outside. Kai and Jinora pause at the mouth of the entrance. Cut to a close up of the air bisons which are unaware of the commotion. View changes to a close up of Kai with his back pressed against the wall as he peeks out at the sky. He waves at them to move forward but as soon as they do, P'li strikes the ground in front of them and the airbenders retreat back into the walkway. P'li sends another attack at the spot where Kai was just at. Cut back to the inside of the corridor as Kai gives a yelp and presses his back on the wall again.)</i><br><br><b>Pema:</b> <i>(clutches Rohan closer to her body)</i> It's too dangerous. <i>(View switches to the camera looking out of the walkway as the airship slowly circles in the air)</i> We'll never make it to the stables with her up there.<br><br><i>(Kai looks defeated and the camera zooms in on him. Scene changes to Zaheer cartwheeling in the air and landing on the ground as Tenzin chases him. Tenzin sends a blast of air at Zaheer and the Red Lotus leader somersaults backwards to avoid the attack. Tenzin attacks him once more and Zaheer leaps onto a nearby statue, using it to climb up to the second floor. Cut to an overhead shot of Zaheer as he grunts when he grabs the railing of the second floor. Tenzin can be seen jumping upwards to follow him. Zaheer bends himself to the third floor and we cut to the rooftop as Zaheer appears but his jump gets interrupted by Tenzin bending a gust of air at him from below.<br><br>Zaheer lands on his shoulder on the roof but he quickly pushes himself off the ground as Tenzin appears on the rooftop, sending another attack at Zaheer who shifts his body to the side and he continues to run across the roof. Tenzin sends a second blast but Zaheer still dodges, leaping up the wall of a nearby building to land a small rooftop sticking out of the wall. Tenzin propels himself to the roof in one clean movement. Cut to an overhead view of the confrontation as Zaheer bends at Tenzin who swipes the attack away. Zaheer cartwheels backwards to kick a blast of air at Tenzin but the airbending master swipes it away with his hands again. Zaheer kicks again but Tenzin continues to knock the air away.<br><br>Zaheer then leaps up a few smaller rooftops to land on a long ledge and assumes he is safe from Tenzin but the master leaps up from behind him and kicks a blast at Zaheer, knocking the Red Lotus leader backwards. Cut to Zaheer who catches himself on the ground and spins his legs to right himself. As he does so, he sends an attack to Tenzin. Zaheer somersaults forward and sends a second attack from his feet. Cut to Tenzin who jumps up and twists his body to avoid the blast. As he lands, Zaheer is very close to him so Tenzin thrusts both palms out to bend a gale at Zaheer. However, Zaheer jumps above Tenzin's head and the frame rate slows down as Tenzin glances at Zaheer leaping over him. The frame rate returns back to normal when Zaheer lands on his feet and quickly places a hand on the ground, pushing himself off the ledge and angling his legs at Tenzin with yet another attack.<br><br>Scene fades to Kya getting pushed backwards by a stream of water and she intercepts the liquid, allowing it to accumulate in front of her before it bursts, throwing her off momentarily. Ming-Hua jumps up and Kya gasps, running off to the side and rolling on the ground. Ming-Hua slaps her water arm at the spot where Kya was just at. Ming-Hua swings and extends her water arms as they turn into ice scythes. The first swing decapitates a statue and Kya dodges the second swing. Cut to a close up of Kya as she ducks again to avoid the third swing and the frame rate slows down when the fourth swing slides very close to Kya's torso. Kya moves her hands up and breaks the ice, creating a shard. The frame rate returns to normal and she tosses it at Ming-Hua like a boomerang. Ming-Hua catches the fragment with her water arm and sends it to Kya along with a second shard. Ming-Hua also sends a third ice chunk. <br><br>Cut to Kya swiping the first ice piece away, followed by the second but she stops and looks at her arm weirdly when she's done with the second chunk. Kya doesn't notice the third piece and it slams head on into her and she is pushed backwards against the wall. Ming-Hua takes the opportunity by forming her water arms into an ice drill and she smiles with glee as she drills her way towards Kya. Katara's daughter rolls on the ground and bends more water from the fountain and sends it towards Ming-Hua. Cut to the balcony outside as Ming-Hua is thrown out of the courtyard and off the balcony into the abyss below as the water follows her.<br><br>Camera focuses on the huge puddles left on the ground as Kya walks into the balcony, holding onto her injured shoulder. The puddles slowly disappear and Kya is alarmed. A few seconds later, Ming-Hua pulls herself back up and she now has six water arms.)</i><br><br><b>Kya:</b> No!<br><br><i>(Cut to a close up of Ming-Hua as she grins evilly and sends three arms at Ming-Hua. View changes back into the courtyard as Kya is pushed back into it and she skids along the ground. Ming-Hua swings in like a spider and Kya runs off. Upstairs, we can see Bumi running along the second floor and the corridor above him turns into lava, forming a hole. Ghazan runs along the third floor and drops in down from the hole to chase Bumi. The lavabender than turns the corridor into lava and it quickly catches up to Bumi and he jumps upwards with airbending to go over the ledge before heading back on the ground. Bumi rolls on the ground to protect his head and when he properly lands, the earth beneath him glows red hot.<br><br>Camera pans out to Ghazan punching his arm upwards as a stream of lava shoots up from the ground beneath Bumi but the commander uses airbending to leap away in time. Ghazan bends the lava and sends it to Bumi who runs up the wall and propels himself from the surface with airbending, sending him towards Ghazan. Cut to the ground behind Ghazan as Bumi slides on the ground in between Ghazan's legs. Bumi pushes himself off the ground and jumps onto Ghazan's back, wrapping both arms around his neck in an attempt to choke him. Ghazan flails around comically and he attempts to reach backwards to grab Bumi but the airbender tugs on Ghazan's long hair, causing the lavabender to yelp.<br><br>Cut to a close up of Bumi as he sinks his teeth in Ghazan's shoulder. Camera pans out and Ghazan earthbends a pillar behind him, flinging Bumi off his back. View changes to Bumi on the ground as he gets up and Kya can be seen entering the frame in the background as she avoids two shots of water from Ming-Hua. The armless waterbender swings in anyway and slaps Kya back to her brother. The siblings stand back to back and pant as they get into bending stances but also looking afraid at the same time.)</i><br><br><b>Bumi:</b> <i>(still panting)</i>  I see you're having as much fun as I am.<br><br><i>(Scene changes to an overhead view of the airship with multiple pockmarks on the ground as P'li combustion bends again. Cut back to the sheltered walkway where the airbenders are still hiding.)</i><br><br><b>Kai:</b> I can't wait any longer. <br><br><i>(He walks up to Daw and grabs a glider staff from him before heading out of the tunnel.)</i><br><br><b>Jinora:</b> Wait, <i>(Kai stops in his tracks)</i> what are you doing?<br><b>Kai:</b> <i>(glances back at Jinora)</i> Whatever I can. <i>(runs out into the open)</i> Get to the bison! Get out of here!<br><br><i>(View changes to P'li who takes aim. Cut back to Kai on the ground as he runs forward and narrowly avoids getting hit by P'li twice. He gets thrown off the balcony at the second blast but he opens his glider and flies. P'li blasts the spot beside him and there is a lot of turbulence as the glider shoots forward. Cut to another shot of Kai as he flies past the airship and P'li tries to hit him but her shot lands on the mountainside. Cut to P'li who returns her attention back to the other airbenders who are desperately running to the air bison stables. <br><br>Cut back to Kai who notices that P'li isn't attacking him and he angles his glider, sending him back to the airship. Cut to P'li as Kai flies into view and she has just combustion bended but Kai bends a gust of air at her, causing her to lose aim and hitting more of the mountain above the fleeing airbenders. View changes to P'li as she turns her head slowly to track Kai's movements in the air. Cut to Kai as he hears the combustion attack and he quickly airbends a sphere around him. The blast hits the air shield and we cut to Jinora who turns around and sees Kai falling.)</i><br><br><b>Jinora:</b> <i>(tears in her eyes)</i> Kai! No.<br><br><i>(Switch to an unconscious Kai as he plummets down the mountain. Cut to the air bisons in the stables but P'li scares them away with combustion bending, leaving the airbenders stranded with no hope to escape. Everyone looks up at the airship and we cut to P'li glancing down at them with an unreadable expression on her face.<br><br>Scene changes to Bumi getting hit by water and landing in the balcony Ming-Hua recently fell from. Cut to an overhead shot of the balcony as Kya walks into frame with a stream of water surrounding her. She uses to water to bend up a wall of ice to intercept a chunk of earth. The siblings' clothes are torn and blackened. Another earth attack shatters Kya's ice, causing Bumi to lose his footing briefly and he glances at the hole in the ledge behind him. Cut to Ghazan as he punches the ground, sending an earth snake at Kya and Bumi who are thrown off the balcony.<br><br>As they fall, Bumi slows his descent with airbending and manages to grab onto a ledge below. He grabs onto his sister with the other hand and the dangle precariously.)</i><br><br><b>Bumi:</b> I got you.<br><br><i>(Cut to a close up of Bumi holding Kya's wrist. Camera pans up to Bumi who strains and something catches his attention off-screen. Cut to a shot of the airship circling around the corner towards the siblings. Camera focuses on P'li for a split second before it cuts to an overhead shot of Bumi and Kya.)</i><br><br><b>Kya:</b> Bumi, let go.<br><b>Bumi:</b> But we could die.<br><b>Kya:</b> We're gonna die if we hang on.<br><br><i>(Cut to P'li who unleashes her attack and a flash of bright light emits from her forehead as the frame rate slows again. Cut back to Bumi with his eyes closed and the frame rate returns to normal as he releases his hold on the ledge and brother and sister fall. A second later, P'li's shot hits the ledge. Bumi and Kya scream as they pass through a small bush on the cliffside. They slide along the length of the cliff wall before rolling off the ledge and hitting two more tree branches and landing roughly on another ridge below. Both groan with pain but are unable to get up.<br><br>Scene changes to Tenzin on a walkway avoiding an air attack as he sends one back to Zaheer who dodges. Tenzin leaps over Zaheer when he airbends again and Zaheer quickly kicks backwards. Tenzin swiftly avoids the blast by standing on one leg and bending back in a T-shape position in the same pose as Aang in the opening sequence. As he does that, he shoots a stream of air from his fingers, sending Zaheer back. Tenzin runs up to Zaheer and jumps up to land a finishing blow. As he jumps, P'li combustion bends the mountain beside Tenzin, knocking him off course down to the courtyard below.<br><br>Cut to Tenzin who cushions his fall with airbending and his robes are now singed. He lands on the ground in a bending pose but he gets hit by a stream of water and a slab of rock from off-screen, making him fall to the ground. Tenzin stands up and spins around in a circle to avoid small ice spheres. One ice orb shatters against his outstretched palm. A small chunk of rock hits him when he's distracted and another ice ball along with an additional rock strikes him. A gust of air from off-screen knocks him to the ground.<br><br>View switches to Tenzin sliding along the ground in front of Ming-Hua as Ghazan and Zaheer surround him. Cut to a haggard Tenzin as he struggles to stand and camera quickly pans out to him sending blasts of air in all three directions, catching the Red Lotus members by surprise. He forms a protective shield of air around him but P'li strikes him from the airship. Cut to a pillar as Tenzin slams against it and falls to the ground. Tenzin places a hand on the wall and slowly stands up. Cut to a close up of Tenzin as he groans with pain and grabs his shoulder with one hand. One of his eyes is bruised. Zaheer steps into frame and we cut to an overhead view of the Red Lotus having Tenzin surrounded.)</i><br><br><b>Zaheer:</b> Give up. It's over.<br><br><i>(Cut to a profile shot of Tenzin's bruised face.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> As long as I'm breathing, <i>(opens his eyes to look at Zaheer)</i> it's not over.<br><br><i>(Camera pans out and Tenzin weakly attacks Zaheer who avoids the shot. Zaheer retaliates by air blasting Tenzin back to the pillar. Cut to a close up of Tenzin as he pants. View changes to Zaheer as he narrows his eyes. Cut to the back of the courtyard with the Red Lotus far behind in the background. Camera slowly pans left towards a wall as the Red Lotus members take turns to attack Tenzin who doesn't fight back and grunts with each hit. As the camera finally hits the wall, we can't see the showdown any more but we can hear Tenzin let out a cry of pain.<br><br>Scene changes to a close up of an unconscious Kai and a bison tongue enters the frame to lick his face. Kai stirs and opens his eyes.)</i><br><br><b>Kai:</b> Whoa! <br><br><i>(Camera zooms out quickly to reveal Kai hanging upside down with one of his legs stuck in between a pair of tree branches. We can see a curious baby bison flying beside him. The bison flies down off-screen and Kai slowly sits up to grab the branch, freeing his leg. He drops down and camera pans down to him landing on the baby bison's back.)</i><br><br><b>Kai:</b> <i>(rubs the bison's head affectionately)</i> Thanks, buddy. Yip-yip.<br><br><i>(The calf turns around and flies away from the camera, off into the distance)</i><br><br><br><br>[End Credits]<br>

No!

Pabu struggles really hard to pull the scarf away as Naga passively sits on the floor without batting an eyelid. Naga then growls and begins to pull the scarf before standing up. The scarf and Pabu dangles off the ground. Pabu squeaks and Yin walks in with anxiety.)</i><br><br><b>Yin:</b> <i>(touches Naga's snout as the polar bear-dog releases the scarf)</i> No. <i>(pulls the scarf away and looks at it between her hands)</i> Not Mako's scarf! <i>(frowns and scolds the pets)</i> Bad dog and rat-thingy! <i>(places arms akimbo and the animals' ears droop with sadness)</i> I'm very disappointed in you two.<br><br><i>(Naga and Pabu hang their heads in shame.<br><br>View changes to a scenic shot of the airship flying past the mountains at night with a full moon high up in the sky.

You just had to believe in yourself.<br><b>Bolin:</b> You're right. Being moments from death was a pretty good motivator too. Of course, we never would have made it back without Kai.<br><b>Kai:</b> <i>(smiles)</i> Glad I could help. So anyway-<br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(interrupts and Kai frowns)</i> Did Zaheer get away with Korra?<br><b>Lin:</b> I'm afraid so.<br><b>Su:</b> Apparently, <i>(everyone turns to Su)</i> he can fly now. <br><br><i>(The youths and Tenzin raise their eyebrows with surprise.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> What?<br><b>Asami:</b> How? <br><b>Bolin:</b> Are you sure?<br><b>Lin:</b> I wouldn't believe it either if I hadn't seen it for myself.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> I've heard the legends about Guru Laghima's ability to fly.

I followed it to some caves a few miles from here. <i>(Mako and Tenzin raise their eyebrows)</i> That giant lady met up with some people who took the airbenders into the caves.<br><b>Lin:</b> Was it Ghazan and Ming- Hua?<br><b>Kai:</b> No, there were four more of them. <i>(stands up)</i> Didn't look familiar.<br><b>Mako:</b> Must be more Red Lotus members than we thought.<br><b>Kai:</b>  I couldn't fight them all on my own.

I probably deserved it.<br><b>Mako:</b> Yeah, you kinda did.<br><br><i>(Scene changes to the mountain ridges covered in fog and Kai and his bison fly into view.

Ming-Hua does the same.)</i><br><br><b>Ghazan:</b> How'd you figure out how to do it?<br><b>Zaheer:</b> <i>(cut to a close up of his face)</i> I found true freedom. I am no longer bound to this earth by worldly desires. <i>(turns serious)</i> I have entered the void.<br><br><i>(Switch to a profile shot of Ming-Hua and Ghazan as they glance at each other quietly before looking back at Zaheer.)</i><br><br><b>Ming-Hua:</b> Where's P'li?<br><br><i>(Camera angle returns back to Zaheer as he slowly lowers himself down to the ground and stands.)</i><br><br><b>Zaheer:</b> <i>(softly)</i> She sacrificed her life for our cause.

Green crystals surround the area Korra is held in. Zaheer walks up to the platform in front of Korra. Camera switches to a profile shot as Ming-Hua and Ghazan follow their friend. Two more unknown figures are seen standing in the background behind them.<br><br>Cut to a close up of Korra as she stirs and opens her eyes with a gasp.

You killed my father.<br><br><i>(Korra breathes fire from her mouth and we cut to a side view shot of the scene as the fire doesn't have enough range to reach the Red Lotus members. The flames dissipate soon after. Cut back to Zaheer who gazes at Korra dispassionately.)</i><br><br><b>Zaheer:</b> I understand your grief. <i>(looks down sadly)</i> I also lost someone I loved today. <i>(frowns and returns to glance up at Korra)</i> But your pain will soon be over. <i>(turns around and steps aside to reveal the two unknown hooded Red Lotus members)</i> Bring the poison.<br><br><i>(They walk forward and we can see one man is holding an intricate basin in his hand while the other has his hands clasped together under the robes. Cut to Korra looking worried and fearful. Cut to the black liquid in the basin as the man with his hands clasped removes his hands from his robe and bends the up the liquid into a small stream.<br><br>Camera switches to a shot between the two men with Korra in the middle in the background.

Ming-Hua avoids the fire and jumps up, swinging around the crystals on the ceiling with her water arms. Mako chases after the armless waterbender and camera pans to Bolin bending a rock at Ghazan who punches it into smithereens. Bolin sends another boulder again and Ghazan raises a wall of earth to protect himself. He then bends the wall to Bolin who bends it in clean in half. As he does so, Ghazan has been following the wall closely and he now tackles Bolin by the waist, causing them to roll along the ground. Bolin throws the older lavabender off and when Ghazan lands on the ground, he quickly sends two slabs of rock towards Bolin.

He flies past a snowy looking mountain before sailing under the clouds and then finally back out into the open over some more mountain ridges. He flies up and more boulders are flung at him from off-screen. Zaheer continues to fly on and Korra finally enters the screen, flying with her firebending.

Switch to Zaheer free-falling unsteadily and he looks up. Cut to Korra who yells out a battle cry and moves her hand in a punching movement.

But we <i>can</i> follow her example of service and sacrifice. <i>(cut back to a close up of Tenzin)</i> So while she recuperates, the Air Nation will reclaim its nomadic roots and roam the Earth. <i>(camera pans across the new airbenders standing behind Jinora)</i> But unlike our ancestors, we will serve people of <i>all</i> nations, working wherever there is corruption and discord, to restore balance and peace. <i>(At the end of the line of airbenders, we can see Ryu in Air Nomad clothes and his arms are crossed.

Bolin does so too. Suddenly, the brakes of the train are engaged and they yell with surprise as they lose their balance, spilling tea on their clothes. Cut to the outside as the train gradually pulls to a stop. We return back to the inside of the train to reveal Kuvira, still standing tall and proud as she appears unfazed. She takes a step backwards to balance herself and looks out the window. We return back to the other four people in the carriage as Zhu Li tries to soak up the tea stain on Varrick's shirt with a napkin. Kuvira walks forward and camera pans up to reveal a guard in the carriage.)</i><br><br><b>Kuvira:</b> Why <i>(the guard gives Kuvira a salute)</i> have we stopped?<br><b>Guard:</b> <i>(drops his hand and bows his head)</i> Apologies, there are rocks on the tracks.

Switch to view of the train as Kuvira climbs out and stands atop the train. Cut to a close up of her as she looks around and then gazes up the canyon. Camera pans up to reveal people hiding on top of the cliffs. The bandits immediately earthbend a little board of earth underneath their feet as they 'surf' down the cliffside.

She then extends her arms out as she catches the second boulder with her bending and flings it away. Kuvira quickly turns her body back to intercept another chunk, sending it flying to the ground. She swiftly steps to the side again to avoid getting hit by a boulder coming from behind her. Cut to a close up of the back of Kuvira's armor as she rapidly metalbends strips of metal out towards the cliffs. Switch to a full body shot of her as she gets into a bending stance and sends more metal strips on the other side of the canyon. She dodges another boulder and bends out more strips. <br><br>Cut to a close up of the bandits as the metal strip wraps around the eyes of the bandit in the foreground, making him yell with surprise. His companion in the background gets the metal strip cuffed around his ankles and he loses his balance, falling off his rocky platform. Another bandit quickly moves further down the cliffside. We return back to Kuvira again as she bends out more metal pieces from her shoulder pad and arm band. As she bends out the last strip, the camera zooms out to the bandits as one gets hit in the eye and falls down. Camera pans across various bandits as they get metal bands wrapped around their eyes, ankles, and wrists. Two bandits manage to run up close to the train and one of them bends up a column of earth and sends it to Kuvira. Cut to a close up of the woman as she fires two strips of metal onto the rock and she spreads her arms apart, separating the rock cleanly into two even pieces and the boulders crash into the cliff behind her.<br><br>The two bandits on the ground try to get away but they quickly get subdued by Kuvira who bends the metal strips over their eyes. Cut to Kuvira as she brings her arms together and we see three bandits coming together as their bands are stuck to each other like magnets. We can hear a female bandit cry out. A fourth bandit joins the pile. Return back to Kuvira as she swiftly moves her arms around and another female bandit loses her balance and falls to the ground. Two bandits sail rapidly towards each other as their wrist bands get connected. Kuvira makes more motions and the remaining bandits 'join' up through magnetized bands in their wrists or ankles. The bandits grunt and we cut to Kuvira looking down at them nonchalantly.<br><br>View changes to the bandits lined up neatly on both sides of the track with their wrists attached to the rail and camera pans up to reveal Kuvira standing on the track with two of her men standing guard behind her. Kuvira opens her arms and the metal bands on all the bandits faces are bent back into her armor.

We didn't know this was your train-<br><br><i>(Cut to Kuvira as she opens her hand and bends a strip of metal off-screen. The camera quickly follows its path as the band covers the female bandit's lips, effectively silencing her and she cries out with surprise but her voice is a little muffled. Cut to a close up profile shot of the female bandit wth Kuvira in the background.)</i><br><br><b>Kuvira:</b> <i>(sternly)</i> Don't talk over me. <i>(puts her hand down and the band falls off the female bandit's mouth)</i><br><br><i>(Switch to a close up of a male bandit looking at his comrade sadly.)</i><br><br><b>Male Bandit:</b> <i>(looks up at Kuvira)</i> Please, take mercy on us.<br><b>Kuvira:</b> <i>(cut to a shot of Kuvira as she frowns)</i> Stop groveling as if this is the worst day of your life. <i>(smiles)</i> This is a good day. I'm going to give you all <i>(turns herself to face the bandits properly)</i> the opportunity to rehabilitate yourselves <i>(camera pulls back to reveal the rest of the bandits)</i> and become <i>productive</i> members of your nation. Right now, you're lost, but pledge your loyalty to <i>me</i>, <i>(camera cuts to three bandits looking at each other, confused)</i> and I'll give you a new purpose in your lives. Of course, <i>(switch to a profile shot of Kuvira's face as she smiles wickedly)</i> if you don't want to join, you could always stay right here. <i>(angles her body to the side)</i> Hopefully someone saves you before the next train speeds through, <i>(turns her back on the bandits)</i> but I wouldn't count on it.<br><br><i>(Switch to a frontal shot of Kuvira with the bandits in the background.)</i><br><br><b>Male Bandit:</b> No, we'll join.

She brings her hands up to shield her face as a chunk of earth smashes against her forearms. Another rock hits her head from the side while a small jagged piece of earth juts out to her belly. Korra cries out in pain and two more smaller pieces of rock fly towards her, pushing her backwards onto the ground.<br><br>Cut to a close up of Korra on the ground as she pushes herself off the ground slightly. We cut to her point of view as her vision swims about and suddenly her opponent turns into phantom Korra. The audience stands are completely blacked out.

Camera zooms out as Korra slides along the floor and earthbends at her phantom but the apparition swiftly jumps up to avoid the attack. The phantom chucks a rock at Korra, knocking her out. Camera focuses on her quivering elbow and pans across it, returning the hallucination back to normal with fans cheering in the stands.)</i><br><br><b>Promoter:</b> We have a winner!<br><br><i>(Korra's competitor raises her arms up in victory as the poor Avatar collapses to the floor. Scene quickly fades to Korra healing herself in the bathroom earlier in the episode.)</i><br><br><b>Man:</b> Hurry up in there!<br><br><i>(Scene changes to Korra dodging the Satomobile earlier. Scene flashes white to a close up of the white puppy barking. The screen flashes again to a shot of a hill with the town in the background.

As Korra runs up to the dog, the creature turns away, barking, and runs past a tree. We can see a white glow from behind the tree and the camera follows. The puppy has turned into the bean spirit seen in the Tree of Time and Korra jumps down from a ledge. The spirit stops running.)</i> <br><br><b>Korra:</b> Wait, I met you at the Tree of Time. <i>(cut to a close up of Korra as she frowns)</i> You should have told me who you were.<br><b>Light Spirit:</b> <i>(cut to the spirit as it turns around to face Korra)</i> If I did, would you have followed me?<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(return back to a shot of Korra)</i> I get your point. <i>(switch to scenic shot of the two)</i> But why did you bring me here?

The frame rate slows down as it closes up on Korra's face. She reacts with shock. Frame rate returns back to normal as Korra slowly stands up and backs away from the phantom.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> You're just in my mind. <i>(cut to a close up of phantom Korra)</i> You're not real.<br><br><i>(The phantom narrows her eyes before moving her arms in a circle, punching fire blasts out from both fists towards Korra.

Cut to her point of view as she looks at the apparition lumbering past some broken vines towards her. <br><br>Return back to Korra as she swiftly bends two streams of water towards the phantom. Cut to the apparition as it seemingly teleports from side to side to avoid the water blasts. When the attack is over, the vision punches out fire, kicks a stream of water, and bends an earth chunk from behind her towards Korra. Switch to the Avatar as she cartwheels backwards to avoid the fire and water but as she lands, the earth chunk hits her in the abdomen, knocking her to the ground and causing her to tumble backwards into a ditch.<br><br>The apparition chases after her and leaps in the air, performing a cartwheel and lighting her foot on fire. Cut to the bottom of the ditch as Korra rolls away to avoid getting fire stomped on. Korra gets up and runs away but the phantom sends another blast of water at her, causing her to fall and slide along the muddy ground. Korra quickly recovers and pushes herself up, running away from the apparition which teleports a few feet and punches fire at Korra. Cut to a back view shot of the Avatar as she ducks, allowing the attack to sail over her head harmlessly. She earthbends a piece of earth towards the screen before propelling herself off the ground by airbending with her feet. Korra lands on a tree branch and propels herself up again.<br><br>Cut to a close up of phantom Korra as she violently shakes her arm down and unwinds the chains around her wrist before slamming the length of the chain to the ground like a whip. She swings the chain upwards and the camera follows the makeshift whip as it coils itself around Korra's ankle. Cut to Korra, in the midst of climbing up a tree branch, as she gets yanked down by the chain and she grabs a branch vine to support herself. Return back to a slight overhead shot of the apparition again as the mud beneath her feet gradually turns into the metallic liquid poison that the Red Lotus used in the previous book. <br><br>Return to Korra as she props her foot on another vine, trying to pull herself up to the top of the tree branch. Cut back to the phantom as she slowly descends into the metallic poison like quicksand, pulling Korra down with her. Switch to Korra as she grunts and valiantly continues to hold onto the vines to prevent herself from being tugged down. Cut to the phantom, now chest high in the poison with her chained arm still held up as she continues to sink into the ground. Cut to Korra as one of her hands loses her grip on the vine and she lets go, now dangling from the vine with her remaining hand. Cut to the phantom as her whole head and arms completely go under the poison.<br><br>View changes to Korra struggling really hard but the vine she's holding breaks and she falls down into the pool of meallic poison. Cut to an overhead shot of her as the poison wraps around her limbs and she trashes about, freeing an arm and reaching upwards.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Help!<br><br><i>(The poison coils around her arm and torso and forcibly pulls her into the liquid. The screen goes black. <br><br>Color returns back to the screen to reveal a close up of an unconscious Korra laying in a dark place illuminated in a blue glow. She opens her eyes and the camera briefly goes to her hazy point of view as it tries to focus. She is looking up at a hole in the ceiling and moonlight is shining through the crevice. Camera pans out to a full body shot of Korra sitting up on a wicker bed and rubbing her head. She looks around and we cut to her point of view looking at the walls of a dark cave.)</i><br><br><b>Toph:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> Feeling better?<br><br><i>(Korra turns her head to the sound of the voice and spots an old woman stirring a steaming pot over a fire.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(cut back to Korra with a hand still rubbing her head)</i> Where am I? What happened?<br><b>Toph:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> I was hoping you could tell me. <i>(cut to a scenic shot of the cave with the old woman on one side and Korra on the other)</i> I found you passed out in the mud.<br><b>Korra:</b> How did you know I was out there?<br><b>Toph:</b> I'm pretty tapped into the goings-on around here. <i>(Korra puts her hand down)</i> What brings you to The Swamp, anyway?<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(cut to a slight close up profile shot of a confused Korra)</i> A spirit led me here and told me I was supposed to find someone. Is that you? <br><br><i>(Camera focuses on the lower portion of the old woman's face with Korra in the background. The elderly woman is wearing familiar green robes...)</i><br><br><b>Toph:</b> Beats me. But if your Avatar senses called you here, <i>(she stirs the pot audibly and camera focuses on the bubbling cauldron)</i> you should probably listen <i>(pulls the spoon out of the pot)</i> to them.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(cut to Korra as she gets off the bed)</i> Wait, you recognize me? <i>(stands up and starts to walk towards the old woman)</i><br><b>Toph:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> In a manner of speaking. <i>(Korra is now suspicious as she slowly makes her way towards the stranger)</i> We were good friends in your <i>previous</i> life.<br><br><i>(Korra bends a small flame above her palm to provide more illumination to the cave. Cut to a back view shot of the old woman and she turns around. We finally have a good view of her face. It's an elderly Toph!)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(cut to Korra who is in disbelief)</i> I can't believe it. Toph? <br><b>Toph:</b> <i>(cut to Toph as she chuckles)</i> Nice to see you again, Twinkle Toes. <i>(smiles)</i><br><br><br><br>[End Credits]<br>

So Tenzin tasked Jinora, Ikki, and Meelo with finding the Avatar. Unbeknownst to the kids, Korra found refuge in The Swamp with Toph, who discovered there was still metal poison in her body. But when Toph tried removing it, Korra resisted. Will the airbender kids find the Avatar and help her return to action?<br><br><br><br><b><u>Act I</u></b><br><br><i>(Episode opens to a shot of an air bison and some airbenders in the courtyard on Air Temple Island.

Jinora walks into frame to join her siblings.)</i><br><br><b>Pema:</b> Well, at least I won't have to worry about you <i>(pats the food sack)</i> starving out there.<br><b>Meelo:</b> Mom, we're going to be in the wild, <i>(turns away from Pema slightly and raises an arm out)</i> living off the land. We don't need your food. <i>(Meelo jumps off the railing and turns his back towards Pema, crossing his arms as Poki chirps)</i><br><b>Pema:</b> <i>(reaches into the rucksack)</i> But I made your favorite treat. <i>(pulls out a package wrapped in a leaf)</i><br><b>Meelo:</b> <i>(turns towards his mother)</i> Sweet buns with happy faces on them? <i>(Pema nods and we cut to her point of view with her hand extended out)</i> Well, <i>(walks towards Pema)</i> I guess we're not officially on the road yet.<br><br><i>(Leans against the railing and takes the leaf wrapper into his hand. He then loosens the string that is tied around the leaf with his teeth, revealing a bun with orange-brown icing on it. Poki steps onto the railing with a chirp and he looks at the food.)</i><br><br><b>Meelo:</b> Aw, this one is smudged. <i>(shows the bun to Pema and a bit of the eyebrow and smiling mouth is smudged)</i> I can't eat this.<br><b>Pema:</b> <i>(switch to a profile shot of Pema with her son)</i> You know, sometimes, <i>(gently pokes Meelo on the nose)</i> things get smudged in the wild.<br><br><i>(Cut to a hand pulling on a rope containing the sack of sweet buns, fastening it securely.

Jinora embraces her father.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(pulls away from the hug)</i> Were you able <i>(Meelo and Ikki propel themselves up into the saddle with their airbending)</i> to get a read on Korra yet?<br><b>Jinora:</b> No, but once we're further out, I'll be able to hone in on her spiritual energy. <i>(Pema walks into frame)</i> We should be able to find her within a few days. <i>(Jinora embraces her mother)</i><br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(angles his head upwards to the saddle)</i> Good luck, and be careful. Remember, Jinora's in charge.<br><br><i>(Switch to a shot from behind Tenzin's back as he looks up to the saddle.

Let's roll. <i>(runs off-screen)</i><br><br><i>(Switch to a scenic shot of the outpost as Meelo jumps off the pillar and opens the wings off his glider suit to head towards the town in the background.

I threw some rocks at the Avatar, he got all whiny, and Sokka fell in a hole.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(raises an eyebrow)</i> I thought there'd be more to it than that. What about the time you guys took down the Fire Lord? That must have been epic!<br><b>Toph:</b> <i>(sarcastically)</i> Oh, yeah. <i>(crosses her arms)</i> It was hot, I was on a blimp, and I think a giant turtle showed up. Wow, what a day.<br><b>Korra:</b> Okay, you're terrible at telling stories.<br><b>Toph:</b> You're terrible at listening to them.<br><br><i>(Cut to a full view shot of the two as Korra sighs and starts tapping her foot on the ground.

It is a flying squirrel! Cut back to Ikki.)</i><br><br><b>Ikki:</b> Wait! <i>(picks up the scrap of food the flying squirrel was eating)</i> You dropped your breakfast!<br><br><i>(Ikki propels herself off the ground and chases after the animal. Switch to a shot of the flying squirrel as Ikki enters the frame with her airbender glider suit open and she attempts to hand the food back to the creature. The flying squirrel retaliates by flying upwards and Ikki turns her head to see where it went to but she doesn't take notice of a tree branch in her flight path and she smacks into it.<br><br>Switch to a shot of a barren piece of land with fallen logs as Ikki rolls and tumbles along the dirt. She comes to a stop and sits up, her face is now smudged with the food she was holding. The flying squirrel lands on her head before climbing down to her shoulder to lick the food off her cheek.)</i><br><br><b>Ikki:</b> Hey. <i>(the creature licks up all the food as Ikki chuckles)</i> Does this mean we're friends?<br><br><i>(The flying squirrel chirps and Ikki looks around her and stands up.

She successfully dodges the first two and she proceeds to fly off but the dirt grabs her ankles and pulls her to the ground. Ikki yelps. Her hands get encased in dirt and she lets out another surprised yell. Return back to the soldiers as the one who was earthbending relaxes.<br><br>Cut to Ikki looking distressed as the flying squirrel climbs into her suit, leaving its little tail outside the collar.

Where's your campsite?<br><b>Ikki:</b> Why do you want to know?<br><b>Soldier #2:</b> We just want to get the family back together again. <i>(grabs the plate of macaroons from the table)</i> Maybe we could sit everybody down <i>(switch to a frontal shot of Ikki as she looks at the plate get laid down in front of her)</i> and have a nice plate of macaroons.<br><b>Ikki:</b> <i>(frowns suspiciously)</i> Where did you get those?<br><br><i>(Return back to the previous shot as soldier #2 pulls up a sack of Pema's food from under the table.)</i><br><br><b>Soldier #2:</b> I found a whole sack of food down by the river, <i>(reaches into the sack and pulls out a letter)</i> and with each delicious snack comes a lovely, handwritten note.

Korra backs away hesitantly as her vision slumps to the floor. Cut to a close up of Korra's face as she turns away but gasps. Switch to a full back view shot of her as she sees a vision of herself from Book 2: Spirits getting Raava pulled out of her by UnaVaatu. Korra trips and we cut to a shot of her as she falls flat on her butt. Behind her, there is a flashback of Zaheer and two other Red Lotus members in the Red Lotus cave in Book 3: Change where the metal poison is forced into Korra. Camera pans up to a vision of Korra in chains and camera zooms in on the tortured apparition as she flashes in and out of the Avatar State, clearly in pain.<br><br>Cut to a close up of Korra's face which is now covered in cold sweat and she lets out a yelp. Switch back to Zaheer and the two cult members as they turn around and look towards Korra upon hearing her. Camera suddenly flashes white to Korra on her hands and knees in the present day and Korra looks around, seeing that she is safe in The Swamp. Korra looks down and inhales in an attempt to calm herself. Switch to a overhead shot of her with her knees in the water.<br><br>Location changes to Jinora meditating in front of a monkey statue with Air Nomad-like swirls carved on its chest. A bird chirps and flies past Jinora. Meelo enters the frame groaning as he clutches his stomach with one hand while dragging a purple stained rucksack along the grass with the other. Poki chirps sadly as it drags its stomach along the floor.

This mission is getting worse by the day. <i>(Meelo storms off)</i><br><b>Jinora:</b> <i>(frowns)</i> This isn't only your mission, Meelo. I thought we were doing this as a <i>family</i>.<br><br><i>(Scene changes to an empty plate on a table and camera pans up to the soldiers, now seated on chairs as they listen to Ikki.)</i><br><br><b>Ikki:</b> It seems pretty lonely out here. Where is everybody else? <i>(looks to soldier #1)</i><br><b>Soldier #1:</b> <i>(turns his head away)</i> I don't want to talk about it.<br><b>Soldier #2:</b> Aww, he's just upset because Kuvira's taking all the troops to Zaofu, and we had to stay here. <i>(Ikki looks over to soldier #1 sympathetically)</i><br><b>Soldier #1:</b> <i>(stands up)</i> Well, it's the last city left, and then the <i>whole</i> Empire will be united. <i>(rests an arm on the top bunk)</i> And you know <i>(slams his fist down on the mattress)</i> there's gonna be a <i>huge</i> party afterwards.<br><b>Ikki:</b> It's tough to be left out, huh?

If anyone saw her, they would have reported it. <i>(Ikki frowns sadly)</i><br><b>Ikki:</b> <i>(camera focuses on a green section on the map)</i> What about this place?<br><br><i>(Return back to a back view shot of Ikki with a full view of the room and soldiers.)</i><br><br><b>Soldier #1:</b> Oh, that's The Swamp. No one goes there.<br><b>Soldier #2:</b> <i>(gives a small smile)</i> Don't get discouraged, Ikki. You're a valuable member of the team, and you have a big heart. I know you're gonna find her. Now, let's get you out of those ropes. <i>(stands up)</i><br><br><i>(The door to the guard house gets blasted inwards by Meelo, revealing him and Jinora standing at the doorway.

Cut to a close up of the soldiers as they slam against the wall behind them and slide down to the ground. Cut to Ikki as she stands up, pushes the map down on the table, and glares at her siblings. She looks back at the soldiers and quickly glances back to her family with another glare.)</i><br><br><b>Meelo:</b> <i>(cut to a close up of Meelo as he folds his arms)</i> You're welcome, Ikki.<br><b>Ikki:</b> <i>(return back to a shot of Ikki as she pushes the rope down and stands on the chair)</i> Why did you do that?<br><b>Jinora:</b> <i>(switch back to a shot of Jinora and Meelo)</i> We're saving you! <i>(turns away)</i> Let's go.<br><b>Ikki:</b> <i>(return back to Ikki as she jumps down from the chair)</i> I had everything under control. <i>(slings the sack of food over her shoulder)</i> I just found our food, and I have an idea where Korra is.<br><br><i>(Return back to a full shot of the room with the trio.)</i><br><br><b>Jinora:</b> You do? Then let's get going!<br><b>Ikki:</b> <i>(puts the sack down on the floor and rummages)</i> Hold on.<br><br><i>(Cut to a shot of the unconscious soldiers as Ikki enters the frame.

I'm all ears.<br><b>Toph:</b> You said you saw your past enemies.

You ever consider maybe you could <i>learn</i> something from them?<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(return back to the duo as Korra raises an eyebrow)</i> Sounds like The Swamp's messing with your mind too.<br><b>Toph:</b> My mind is just fine, thank you. <i>(cut to a close up of Toph)</i> Listen, <i>(camera pans off to the right into the empty space behind her)</i> what did Amon want? <i>(a shot of Amon with the equality symbol appears)</i> Equality for all. Unalaq? <i>(the vision of Amon fades away and is replaced with a shot of a possessed Unalaq and UnaVaatu)</i> He brought back the spirits. <i>(the vision of Unalaq fades and is replaced by Zaheer, P'li, Ming-Hua, and Ghazan)</i> And Zaheer believed in freedom. <i>(the camera pans towards Korra)</i><br><b>Korra:</b> I guess.<br><b>Toph:</b> <i>(switch to a profile shot of the scene)</i> The problem was, those guys were totally out of balance, and they took their ideologies too far.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(return back to a close up of a frowning Korra)</i> Okay, fine. But that doesn't explain why they keep haunting me.<br><b>Toph:</b> <i>(cut to a close up of Toph)</i> Because you need to face your fears. <i>(turns her head towards the Avatar and camera switches to a shot of Korra)</i> You can't expect to deal with future enemies if you're still fighting the old ones. <i>(Korra looks to the side)</i><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(accepts Toph's words)</i> Maybe you're right, <i>(turns to her teacher)</i> but how am I supposed to move on?<br><br><i>(Return back to a full body shot of the two.)</i><br><br><b>Toph:</b> Boy, you Avatars <i>(sticks a finger into her ear)</i> sure need a lot of hand-holding. <i>(stands up)</i> Get up. <i>(walks away)</i> We're going to the Banyan Grove Tree.<br><br><i>(Cut to Korra who looks confused a first but she pushes herself off the root and follows anyway.<br><br>Scene changes to a shot of the trees in the Swamp in the evening.

It's like I'm... concerned <i>(camera pulls back to reveal the backs of Kuvira and her fiance)</i> with others. And there's this nagging voice <i>(Zhu Li enters the frame, sweeping the floor)</i> in my head constantly telling me what's right from wrong.  <br><b>Zhu Li:</b> I believe that voice is your conscience, Sir. <i>(continues sweeping)</i><br><b>Kuvira:</b> Well, I'm the other voice in your head, and I'm telling you, you will continue this project.<br><b>Varrick:</b> <i>(places a hand out at Kuvira)</i> Sorry, no.

After tensions flared between Su Bei Fong and her former protege, Korra brokered a truce. But it was too late. Su and her sons were already on their way to put an end to Kuvira. Meanwhile, Bolin and Varrick learned of Kuvira's true tyrannical intent and deserted her army. But they were captured and betrayed by Zhu Li. Now they're being held against their will.<br><br><br><br><u><b>Act I</b></u><br><br><i>(Episode opens to Kuvira's campsite at night and mechatanks stand guard around Kuvira's tent. Camera pans out to a full view of the campsite and searchlights can be seen searching up and down the camp grounds in the distance. In the foreground, a soldier patrols the hill near the campsite with a flashlight in hand. Suddenly, a strip of metal is bent around his mouth and his shouts are muffled. He throws away the light in surprise as a cable shoots out from a nearby bush and wraps around his ankles, knocking him off his feet. He continues to groan behind the makeshift gag as his body is dragged into the shrubs. Cut to a view of the bushes and camera pans up to the branch of the tree above the bush as three cables shoot out and wrap themselves around the tree branch.<br><br>Switch to a slight close up of the branch as the cables reel upwards. Three figures clad in black stealth suits land on the branch and they are the silhouettes of Su and her twin sons.)</i><br><br><b>Wing:</b> <i>(whispers)</i> Are you sure this will work? <i>(cut to a close up of the trio)</i> Even without Kuvira, they could still crush us.<br><b>Su:</b> Most of this army has been forced into service by Kuvira. If we take her out, they'll have no reason to fight. <i>(cut to a frontal shot of Su's face as she pulls the hood of her suit up, covering her head)</i> Tonight we end her reign of terror. <i>(she pulls up another portion of her mask to cover her mouth and nose, only leaving her eyes unprotected)</i><br><br><i>(Scene changes to a mechatank patrolling the grounds where the tanks are parked. Camera pans down a tank to reveal Su and her sons hiding under it. Cut to an aerial shot of the tanks, supply crates, and the mechatank walking away as the three of them quickly come out from under the tank and run forward quietly. Switch to a shot of even more parked tanks as Su peeks out from behind one and quickly ducks behind it when a searchlight beams in her direction. As the light moves away, Su and her son move forward. In the foreground, the other twin advances as well. <br><br>Cut to a bunch of supply crates and energy generators in front of Kuvira's tent as the three of them take cover behind the makeshift barricade. Su stands up and we cut to one of her eyes peeking through the gaps between the crates as we hear a mechatank stomping off-screen. Switch to her point of view as said mechatank trudges past in front of her. Return back to a full body shot of Su as she stomps one foot on the ground and the camera switches to a very familiar seismic sense that Toph uses. The screen goes black and white shockwaves radiate outwards from Su's foot, towards the mechatanks and into Kuvira's tent where we see Kuvira sleeping on a bed in the middle of her tent. Return back to Su as she addresses her sons.)</i><br><br><b>Su:</b> <i>(whispers)</i> She's alone in there.

All three of them disappear into the ground like moles. Cut to the floor of Kuvira's tent as a hole is bent open in the metallic floor and Su and her sons jump up from the hole. Switch to the cable holder on Su's hip as she shoots out a cable. Camera pans out to Kuvira's sleeping form with her arms up in front of her face as the cable wraps around Kuvira's torso. Su tugs the body towards her and we cut to a frontal shot of Zhu Li dressed up as Kuvira. It was a trap!)</i><br><br><b>Zhu Li:</b> Don't hurt me! <br><b>Su:</b> <i>(cut to Su as she pulls down her hood to reveal her whole head)</i> Zhu Li?<br><br><i>(Alarms blare and we switch to a shot of Kuvira's tent as the walls are pulled away.

I have to save my family!<br><b>Korra:</b> No, <i>(rests a hand on Opal's shoulder)</i> Jinora is right. Your mom attacked the camp.

They have been hoarding their riches and technology too long. <i>(cut to Kuvira, still with a no-nonsense expression on her face)</i> I'm here to distribute those resources fairly throughout the nation. This is about equality.<br><b>Opal:</b> <i>(return back to profile shots of the girls)</i> You don't care about equality! This is about control! <i>(to Korra)</i> Just take her down. You know it's the right thing to do.

Cut briefly to Su and her sons, then to Kuvira, then to Korra, Opal, and Jinora.)</i><br><br><b>Jinora:</b> Are you really ready to fight her?<br><b>Korra:</b> Just stay back and let me handle this. It's been a while, but I got <i>a lot</i> of pent-up rage.<br><b>Opal:</b> Don't mess around. Kuvira is too good. Just go into the Avatar State and get it over with. <br><b>Korra:</b> No, I'm only going to use that as a last resort.<br><b>Jinora:</b> <i>(touches Korra's arm)</i> Be careful.<br><br><i>(Opal and Jinora walk back and Korra pops her neck and gets into a fighting stance.

Kuvira evades the attacks, and Korra follows up with a jumping roundhouse kick that sends out an arc of fire. Kuvira ducks under it and evades another fire punch. Korra kicks a large rock at Kuvira, but she leans out of the way, as well as avoiding another fire blast by ducking. Kuvira dashes forward and knocks away Korra's next punch with a small spire of rock, then follows up by flinging a rock at Korra's stomach. Korra grunts and stumbles back, and Kuvira throws two metal strips which latch onto Korra's wrist and ankle. The Avatar only has a short moment to look down before Kuvira swings her arms in a circular motion to the side, and Korra goes cartwheeling through the air and landing hard on the ground. Kuvira's soldiers cheers, and we see Zhu Li clapping with a bemused expression.)</i> <br><br><b>Kuvira:</b> <i>(chuckles and bounces on the balls of her feet)</i> Looks like the Avatar is a little off her game.<br><br><i>(Korra slowly pushes herself back up and gets into her stance. Cut to Opal and Jinora.)</i><br><br><b>Opal:</b> Don't let her get you frustrated! She wants you to make a mistake!<br><br><i>(Cut to a close up of Korra as she squints. Korra does a wide uppercut and bends up a wave of rocks underneath Kuvira, but Kuvira rolls to the side and then backflips when Korra swings her other fist and sends out a blast of air. Korra runs up the rocks and then propels herself higher with a rock spire before doing a flying side kick and sending another strong air blast at Kuvira. Kuvira ducks to the side, and as Korra lands she does a side kick and shoots out a blast of fire. Kuvira ducks under it and does a sweeping kick, bending the earth under Korra's foot to trip her. Korra is able to land on her shoulder and quickly bounce back on her feet, but just as she does so, Kuvira does a jumping roundhouse and flings a rock into her stomach once more, knocking Korra down. Korra quickly gets back up and wildly throws out a fire blast, then an air blast, both of which Kuvira easily evades. Korra runs at Kuvira, uses earthbending to jump high and does a flaming flying knee, but Kuvira still evades. <br><br>Korra throws out another air blast, then follows up with a spinning back kick which sends a large rock at Kuvira, followed up by another spinning kick that shoots out an arc of flame. Kuvira continues to evade all attacks by weaving to the side, and after she evades another boulder, Kuvira thrusts her elbow foward and sends a small wave of earth at Korra's foot. This makes her stumble forward, and leaves Korra open to a metal strip to wrap around her eyes, blinding Korra. Korra is then hit by a rock from below and sent flying back, skidding over the ground. The soldiers cheer as Korra takes the strip off her head and looks worriedly at Kuvira, who is in a low stance, smirking and with her hand forward in an almost beckoning manner. Korra stands back up and yells as she throws out another fire blast. <br><br>Scene changes to Baatar Jr's train speeding down the tracks. Cut to Bolin, Varrick, and Baatar Jr. inside the lab as Varrick works on the machine.)</i>  <br><br><b>Varrick:</b> <i>(raises a hand up and beckons Bolin)</i> Bolin, do the thing.<br><b>Bolin:</b> What thing? <br><b>Varrick:</b> <i>(irritably)</i> The thing! <i>(turns around to face Bolin )</i> I never had to tell Zhu Li <i>what</i> thing!<br><b>Bolin:</b> I'm not Zhu Li, okay? <i>(annoyed)</i> Pretend I don't know anything about anything that's happening here. Also pretend I don't want to build a super weapon or get my hands blown off.<br><br><i>(Varrick stands up and walks over to the table nearby to grab a pair of pliers. He holds it up right in Bolin's face as he walks back to the spirit vine contraption.)</i><br><br><b>Baatar Jr.:</b> <i>(walks towards Varrick, touches his shoulder, and bends down to the inventor's level)</i> Walk me through what you're doing. I want to know every detail of your work.<br><b>Varrick:</b> <i>(puts a hand on Baatar Jr's chest and shoves him away lightly)</i> You know, when I started working with the vines, <i>(uses the pliers to tinker with the machine)</i> the point was to find a clean, unlimited source of <i>energy</i>, not develop some spirity death ray.<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(enters the frame with enthusiasm)</i> Clean energy, sounds great! Who doesn't like that stuff? Let's do that instead.<br><b>Baatar Jr.:</b> Quiet. <i>(Bolin raises his hands in the air and walks away)</i> You're here to help, not talk. <i>(to Varrick)</i> And <i>you</i> of all people should realize <i>(stands up)</i> that once a discovery is made, it is our responsibility as scientists to pursue it as far as we can, wherever it leads.<br><b>Varrick:</b> <i>(amused)</i> How would you know?

Kuvira evades two fire blasts and an air blast, and then begins throwing out metal strips. Korra evades them, and deflects three with airbending, making the strips lodge themselves into the ground. Korra runs foward and propels herself into the air on a pillar of stone. As she comes down she does a forward flip axe kick that sends out a wave of air, then follows up with a punch. Kuvira dodges to the side and counters by punching upward and sending a large stone cube up at Korra. Korra is knocked out of the sky and falls, rolling over the ground. For a brief moment, Kuvira looks concerned as Korra gets back up again. Korra runs at Kuvira and sends out an air wave with a jumping back kick and then a flaming back hand. Kuvira dodges both, and latches a metal strip around the Avatar's wrist. Kuvira flings Korra into the air, and then straight back to the ground. Cut to a close up profile shot of Kuvira as she smirks. Korra gets on her knees and then quickly rolls out of the way of a wave of rocks Kuvira sends at her. Korra gets to her feets and bends a large stone pillar up to block two large rocks flung at her, taking on a more traditional Earthbending stance. Korra then sends the stone flying at Kuvira, who throws her hands up and stops it in front of her easily. Kuvira smirks as she then sends the stone back at Korra, who not so easily stops it in front of her, being pushed back and grunting from the effort. Korra struggles to hold the stone as Kuvira continues to push it against her. Kuvira frowns a moment before she waves her arms to the sides and makes the stone explode, knocking Korra back onto her knees once more. Cut to a close shot of Korra panting as Kuvira stands in the background, Opal and Jinora far in the background. Cut to a closer shot of Kuvira.)</i><br><br><b>Kuvira:</b> Come on, Avatar. Get up! Show me what you've got.<br><b>Opal:</b> We have to help her.<br><br><i>(Opal begins to run forward, but Korra looks up at her.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> No. Stay back. <i>(stands back up)</i> I can handle this.<br><br><i>(Cut to a close shot of Kuvira and she smirks and retakes her stance. <br><br>The scene changes to Bolin, Varrick, and Baatar Jr. on the train. Bolin is in the foreground and he is very bored as he plays with a screwdriver's tip by flicking the bits under his fingernails with it. In the background, Baatar Jr. scrutinizes the machinery while Varrick continues to tinker with it.)</i><br><br><b>Baatar Jr.:</b> So I see how the current interacts with the vine, and here <i>(touches a tube that connects to all the smaller canisters of vines)</i> is a kind of directional tube, <i>(gestures to the main canister with the biggest spirit vine)</i> but this baffling here at the base... <i>(Bolin sniffs the screwdriver tip and recoils from the stench)</i> It looks like that would only redirect the energy right back where it came from. <i>(Bolin sniffs the rest of his fingers)</i> And what's <i>(points to Varrick)</i> that piece of equipment <i>(Bolin uses the screwdriver tip to clean the fingernail of his pinky)</i> you're fiddling with now on the power source?<br><b>Varrick:</b> <i>(grunts)</i> Hand me <i>(beckons a hand to Bolin)</i> the screw-turn-thingy, would ya?<br><b>Bolin:</b> Ugh, I can't believe you're helping them. <i>(walks over to Varrick)</i> You know this isn't right.<br><b>Varrick:</b> <i>(cut to a close up of Varrick as Bolin hands him in screwdriver)</i> Funny story, Bolin. I first got the idea for harnessing spirit power <i>(tightens something on the machine with the tool)</i> when I watched that giant Unalaq monster attack the city from my jail cell. That giant monster set me free. <i>(he turns around and faces Bolin with a serious expression his face)</i> Trust me, kid. I know what I'm doing. <br><br><i>(Return to Bolin as he looks baffled by Varrick's cryptic words. Cut to a profile shot of Bolin, Varrick, and Baatar Jr. with the spirit vine canister in between the good guys and the latter.)</i><br><br><b>Varrick:</b> That ought to do it. <i>(looks down at the canister as nothing happens)</i> Huh. <i>(knocks the glass on the canister a few times before taking a step back)</i> Okay, stand back. <i>(He kicks the machine and Baatar Jr. reacts with shock and quickly jumps out of the way. The machine comes to life and all the spirit vine canisters glow purple.)</i> There we go. <i>(a ticking sound is heard)</i><br><b>Baatar Jr.:</b> What's that ticking?<br><b>Varrick:</b> That's the timer.<br><b>Baatar Jr.:</b> <i>(cut to a close up of Baatar Jr. as he looks unamused)</i> The timer for what?<br><b>Varrick:</b> <i>(return back to Varrick as he speaks matter-of-factly)</i> For the bomb, of course!<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(alarmed)</i> What?! What bomb?<br><b>Varrick:</b> <i>(coolly)</i> The bomb that's going to explode in five minutes and destroy this entire train, <i>(Bolin glances around the train car)</i> all of the spirit vines, and everything else within a few hundred yards. <i>(slyly to Baatar Jr.)</i> You know what, I'd get out of here if I were you. <i>(switch to a close up of Baatar Jr. and a train guard as they are appalled)</i> This is the first time I've built a timer, and it might run a little <i>fast</i>. <i>(Baatar Jr. changes his expression to anger)</i> Bolin and I are ready to go down with the ship- or train in this case- but you seem like you have a lot to live for.<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(return back to Bolin and Varrick as the former grabs the latter's uniform with fear)</i> No, no, no, no!

People will say, <i>(Bolin bites his nails nervously)</i> "Hey, what happened to that guy?" "Oh, didn't you hear, he Varrick'd himself because some girl Zhu Li'd him!"<br><b>Baatar Jr.:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> Enough! <i>(the two of them turn towards Baatar Jr. and we switch to a shot of the angered architect)</i> What makes you think we'd let you blow yourself up? You're working for Kuvira. You don't get to quit. <i>(snaps his fingers towards a guard)</i> Grab him.<br><br><i>(The guard behind Baatar Jr. walks forward and we cut back to Varrick and Bolin as the guard behind them advances on the two. Varrick reaches into his pocket and pulls out a detonator.)</i><br><br><b>Varrick:</b> You try <i>(the guard behind him stops in his tracks)</i> to pull me away from this thing, <i>(the guard gets into a bending stance)</i> and I'll hit this remote and blow it immediately.<br><b>Baatar Jr.:</b> <i>(cut to Baatar Jr. as he raises an eyebrow)</i> Why do you have a timer and a remote?<br><b>Varrick:</b> <i>(return back to Varrick as he starts explaining)</i> Well, first I built the timer, but then I thought you could drag me <i>(slides an arm to the side)</i> off the train, so then <i>(looks to the remote in his palm)</i> I built a remote.

The point is, <i>(points the remote to Baatar Jr.)</i> you're leaving! <i>(points the remote to himself)</i> We're staying!<br><br><i>(The scene changes to a close up of Korra yelling and swinging her arm wildly as she throws a fire blast. Kuvira ducks under it, then does a low sweeping kick which spins the ground under Korra's feet just as Korra throws out nother fire blast. Korra stumbles and is turned around, making her attack miss. Korra throws a rock at Kuvira and follows up with a side kick, but Kuvira dodges and latches a metal strip to her ankle and flings Korra into the air again. Korra falls and rolls onto her back. Cut to Su.)</i><br><br><b>Su:</b> You have to go into the Avatar State! Do it!<br><br><i>(Cut to Korra as she looks up to see Kuvira leaping above her and about to attack. Korra's eyes light up as she goes into the Avatar State and she thrusts both palms at Kuvira, blasting her with a very powerful gust of wind. Kuvira is sent flying back and grunts as she skids over the ground on her hands and knees. Korra yells as she flies forward on the wind and hits Kuvira with another blast of air. Kuvira goes rolling across the ground and lands on her side, her hair coming undone. Korra then rises into the air in a small whirlwind, two large rocks by her side and lifting an enormous boulder over her head. Cut to Opal and Jinora, then to Su as they watch in awe. Cut to a close up of Korra as she looks down. Cut to a shot of Kuvira below on her hands and knees, her head down and her face hidden by her hair. Kuvira slowly starts to look up, but as she does so her face is revealed to be that of the Dark Korra vision. Cut to Korra as she looks surprised and is snapped out of the Avatar State. She yells and falls to her knees with the giant boulder. Cut to Opal and Jinora.)</i><br><br><b>Jinora:</b> I don't understand. We got the poison out. What's wrong with her?<br><br><i>(Kuvira stands back up as Korra is still down on her knees.)</i><br><br><b>Kuvira:</b> I knew you were weak.<br><br><i>(Kuvira flings two metal strips at Korra. Korra tries to dash at her, but the strips latch onto her wrists. Kuvira lifts Korra high into the air. Korra stares at Kuvira weakly, and Kuvira smirks just before she slams Korra back into the ground, making the rocks below crumble. Kuvira then lifts Korra up and surrounds her up to her shoulders in stones, trapping her. Cut to Korra as she groans weakly and closes her eyes. Kuvira walks towards Korra slowly, Cut to commercial break.)</i><br><br><br><br><b><u>Act III</u></b><br><br><i>(Fade into a shot of Kuvira as she walks towards the trapped Korra. She raises her arms and summons three metal strips from around each of her biceps. She flexes and the strips turn into curved razor blades. Cut to Korra as she remains unconscious and unresponsive. Cut to Opal and Jinora as each swings their arms upward and sends a wave of air at Kuvira before she can land the killing blow. Kuvira is knocked back and lands at her soldiers' feet. The soldiers help Kuvira up, who frowns angrily.)</i><br><br><b>Kuvira:</b> You broke our agreement! Attack!<br><br><i>(Kuvira's soldiers scream their battle cries and charge at Opal and Jinora, who stand in front of the helpless Korra. Opal and Jinora begin to swing their arms in circular motions and bend a tornado around themselves and Korra. The soldiers shield themselves from the wind, and are knocked around by the rocks and debris kicked up by Korra and Kuvira's fight. Cut to Kuvira shielding herself as the wind pushes her back. Cut back to Opal and Jinora.)</i>  <br><br><b>Jinora:</b> <i>(stops bending)</i> Keep them back!

It chirps and runs out into the open before getting into a stalking position and wagging its little red bushy tail in the air. The fire ferret jumps a couple of steps forward and camera pans down to reveal a mass of white fur. Pabu then pounces and sinks its teeth in the fur. Camera angle changes to a sleeping Naga in the courtyard, unbothered by Pabu biting her tail. Pabu lets go and stalks the tail for a bit before pouncing again.

Korra leans against the top of her companion's head and Naga growls happily as her tail continues to wag. The creature puts a paw on Korra's waist to pull her close. Naga then licks Korra's face and runs around the Avatar, wanting to play.

The soldier looks over to the posters and then quickly turns his head back to the wanted duo. <br><br>Cut to the outside of the door to the guard post as it opens and the soldier rushes out.)</i><br><br><b>Guard Post Soldier:</b> Wait! Stop them! <i>(camera quickly pulls back to Bolin, Varrick, and the prisoners)</i> They're traitors to the Empire!<br><br><i>(The escapees quickly dash forward. Cut to the feet of the mechatanks as they jump off from their posts. Switch to back view shots of Bolin and Varrick as the mechatanks land in front of them. The duo looks behind them fearfully. Change to an overhead shot of the fugitives being surrounded by mechatanks and soldiers. Cut to commercial break.)</i><br><br><br><br><b><u>Act III</u></b><br><br><i>(Episode returns to a shot of Bolin, Varrick, and the escapees surrounded by Earth Empire soldiers and mechatanks.)</i><br><br><b>Baraz:</b> There's no way I'm going back to prison!<br><br><i>(Baraz burns off the rope around his wrists with a small flame from his middle fingers, then does a jumping roundhouse kick that sends a wave of fire at the soldiers, who earthbend up stone pillars to shield themselves. The soldiers launch rocks at the escapees, who free themselves from the ropes and start to fight back. A mechatank shoots a torrent of flame at Bolin and Varrick from its wrist. Bolin blocks it by bending up a stone wall while Varrick cowers behind him. Varrick looks up to see the fire before crawling away. <br><br>Cut to Baraz facing down a charging mechatank. It throws its fist at him, but Baraz rolls behind it and the mechatank punches the ground. The mechatank turns to chase Baraz, and Baraz punches out two fire blasts while Ahnah creates an ice slick on the ground. The mechatank slides over the ice as the fire blasts knock it into the air. Cut to a close up of the mechatank's heel as it lands on the ice, and spikes shoot out from the back of its legs and into the ground, anchoring it and keeping it from slipping. The mechatank raises its arm and begins charging an electric attack. It shoots it at where Baraz and Ahnah are standing. They jump out of the way as the attack makes the ground explode. The mechatank turns to the side and shoots a torrent of fire at Baraz, who punches at it and blocks the fire with his own firebending. <br><br>Meanwhile, three mechatanks run at Bolin. Bolin throws two large rocks at two of them, halting their charge. Bolin then jumps forward and thrusts his palms at the ground, creating a lava pool. He swings his arms to the side to widen it, and then thrusts his palms forward to send the lava at the mechatanks. One mech leaps high above the lava, and starts aiming its electric attack at Bolin. Bolin begins to run out of the way, but the explosion from the attack sends him flying. He quickly rolls back to his feet and assumes his stance. Cut to Varrick hiding inside the gateway as he watches a waterbender being knicked back by a large rock. He winces a moment, and then looks inside the gateway's office and sees a power generator, then smiles.)</i><br><br><b>Varrick:</b> Hahaha!<br><br><i>(Varrick goes inside and grabs a screwdriver from the desk, then lifts the lid from the generator. Cut to him throwing a nearby table over and then removing one of its metal legs with the screwdriver. Cut to a closeup of Varrick grabbing a roll of wire from the floor. He looks out the window at the fight outside worriedly as he holds the screwdriver in his mouth and wraps the wire around the table leg before going back to the generator. <br><br>Cut to Bolin waving his arms to his side and then sending out a wave of lava at a mechatank. It dodges to the side as it runs at Bolin, then jumps over a second attack and rolls as it lands. The mech slams its fists down at Bolin, who rolls to the side. Bolin grunts and raises his fists up to send a wave of stones at the mech that knock it over. Another mech steps forward and shoots electricity at Bolin. Bolin propels himself upward on a stone pillar to avoid it, and the stone is blasted into rubble. <br><br>Cut to a close up of Varrick driving the table leg into the ground, then running back inside the office, the wire leading back into it. Cut to Bolin grunting and rolling back after being hit by an attack. He raises his arms and creates a stone barrier just as three torrents of fire shoot at him. The mechs begin to close in on Bolin as he hides behind his cover. Cut to a close up of Varrick as he clamps two ends of the cable to two terminals on the generator's battery. He wipes his brow with his sleeve.)</i><br><br><b>Varrick:</b> Boy, I sure hope this works. <br><br><i>(Varrick turns the power switch on. Cut to a close up of the table leg and then zoom out as it creates an electromagnetic pulse. Cut to Bolin as he looks up at one of the mechs about to grab him when suddenly the pulse causes it and the other two mechs shooting fire at him to collapse. Cut to a shot of a mech about to swing its fist at Baraz and Ahnah before it sparks and crumples over. Baraz and Ahnah look confused then glance at each other. Cut to Varrick as he clenches his fists and grins triumphantly.)</i><br><br><b>Varrick:</b> Hahaha! I still got that Varrick touch. <br><br><i>(Varrick runs out of the office. Cut to the outside as Bolin peeks out from behind his cover. Varrick runs past him.)</i><br><br><b>Varrick:</b> We're clear. Come on!<br><br><i>(Bolin looks on as the escapees continue to fight the remaining soldiers. Ahnah bends out water as Baraz lifts up an unconscious waterbender. Cut to a close shot of Bolin as he gains his resolve. Cut to Varrick as he stops when Bolin calls out to him.)</i> <br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Varrick, wait! We can't leave them.<br><br><i>(Bolin jumps over his stone barrier and runs forward. Cut to a low angle shot of a waterbender and firebender attacking the soldiers who are hiding behind their own stone barriers. The firebender is knocked back by a rock thrown at him. Cut to Bolin as he runs out in front of the escapees. He jumps and swings his elbow towards the ground, creating a large pool of lava that erupts. Bolin then sends the lava at the soldiers, who quickly fall back behind the gateway.)</i>  <br><br><b>Head Soldier:</b> Retreat!<br><br><i>(Bolin thrusts his palms forward and sends the lava at the gateway behind the soldiers, partially melting the metal wall and blocking the entrance.)</i> <br><br><b>Baraz:</b> Thanks. You didn't have to come back.<br><b>Bolin:</b> Yeah, I kind of did. Let's go.<br><br><i>(Scene changes to the interior of the Central Train Station. Cut to Mako as he looks through the windows of a departing train.)</i><br><br><b>Train Conductor:</b> <i>(over the announcement system)</i> The 4:15 bound for Omashu is now leaving on track number six. All aboard!<br><br><i>(Mako does not see anything and runs off. Cut to Korra looking round as Asami approaches her.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> If we don't find Wu soon, we might <i>never</i> find him.<br><br><i>(Cut to a close up of Korra kneeling down and touching the floor. The spot under her hand glows golden again, and the camera tilts up to her face as Korra looks up and then to the side. Cut to a shot of Korra looking at a train as its doors close and it begins to depart. Korra runs fter it.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> He's on that train!<br><br><i>(Korra, Asami, and Mako manage to get into a train car before it leaves. Cut to them entering the car and walking through it.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> How do you know for sure he's here?<br><b>Korra:</b> I don't. But I had a feeling, okay?<br><b>Mako:</b> And I'm just supposed to trust "Avatar feelings"?<br><b>Korra:</b> You wouldn't have to if you had guarded the prince like you were supposed to!<br><br><i>(Mako and Korra continue, and the camera tilts down to show two of Kuvira's supporters sitting across from each other. They look to each other. Cut to a shot inside the darkened luggage car as Asami opens the door to it and lets in light.)</i> <br><br><b>Mako:</b> Oh, so it's my fault Wu disappeared.<br><b>Korra:</b> It's certainly not mine!<br><br><i>(A large suitcase begans to tap from the inside.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> Guys, shh. Listen. <br><br><i>(Mako closes the door and walks over to the suitcase. He opens it and Wu sit up, flailing his arms and blubbering with fright. Mako grabs his shoulders.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Wu! Wu, it's me.<br><b>Wu:</b> Mako? Where am I? Am I dead? <br><b>Mako:</b> No, you're on a train. We're gonna get you out of here.<br><br><i>(The door to the luggage car opens and they look to see the Kuvira supporters. The male one throws metal strips at Korra, who dodges and deflects them. Korra backs away as she does so and then throws out a strong gust of wind at them which lifts them up, knocking them into the ceiling. They fall with a thud, but a third supporter is seen running towards them. Cut to Asami as she turns to see even more Kuvira supporters coming from the car behind them. Korra metalbends the door in front of her shut, then turns and waves her arms to the sides to metalbend the car's ceiling, spliting it open.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Everyone out.<br><b>Wu:</b> I'm not going up there!<br><br><i>(Cut to a close up of Korra frowning in annoyance. Cut to the outside of the train car as Wu is flung out from below on a gust of wind, landing on top of the car behind. Korra jumps after him and helps Mako and Asami up. The train is passing through the countryside. Cut to a bird's eye view as the train passes over a large river on a bridge. Korra, Mako, Asami, and Wu begin jumping train cars going towards the back. <br><br>Cut to a low angle shot from between cars as they jump over, and Mako tossing Wu over to Korra as the prince yells in fright. We then see the Kuvira supporters exit the train car from below them and use metal cables hidden up their sleeves to pull themselves on top of the train. Mako attempts to firebend at them, but one supporter snares his ankle with a cable and pulls Mako off balance and makes him fall on his back. The supporter throws the cable at Korra as she holds onto Wu. The cable wraps around her wrist as she grabs it. Two more Kuvira supporters jump up behind her and Asami.<br><br>Cut to a shot from the side as Asami ducks under and kicks the supporter's hand before he can metalbend, then thrusts her gloves palm into his chest, shocking him and sending him flying back. The female supporter behind him them metalbends the top of the car, peeling it up towards Asami. Cut to Mako as he gets up and kicks, and sending an arc of fire at the supporter in front of him, cutting the cable holding Korra. Mako punches a fire blast at him, but the supporter backflips out of the way, and the other supporter begins to peel up the other end of the train car. Cut to a far shot as both ends of the train car's top are peeled up towards Korra and her friends. Cut to a closer shot as Korra airbends a whirlwind around them and grabs everyone before jumping off the side.)</i><br><b>Korra:</b> Jump!<br><br><i>(The group yells as they fall down towards the ground below near the water. They bounce off the bridge's support column before hitting the ground, cushioned by Korra's airbending and all yell as they tumble down. Cut to a closer shot as the train passes out of sight and they all get up, Korra sighing in relief. Mako helps Wu up.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> You all right? <br><b>Wu:</b> <i>(hugging Mako)</i> Yes! Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. You are definitely getting a raise, buddy.<br><b>Mako:</b> You should be thanking Korra. We never would have found you without her.<br><b>Wu:</b> <i>(bowing)</i> I owe you my life, Avatar. If only there was some way to repay you. Ooh, I know. <i>(takes Korra's hand)</i> How about I take you out for a night on the town?<br><b>Korra:</b> Really? You're asking me out right now?<br><b>Wu:</b> So...  I'll put you down for a "maybe"?<br><b>Korra:</b> How about a never? <br><br><i>(Korra frowns and takes her hand way from Wu before walking up to Mako and Asami.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Not exactly what I imagined for our first day back together.<br><b>Asami:</b> But it was kind of like old times. Except for the getting on each other's nerves part.<br><b>Mako:</b> Actually, that is like old times for me and Korra.<br><b>Korra:</b> I'm sorry things got so tense earlier.<br><b>Asami:</b> It's all right. I guess after being apart for three years, there's bound to be a bit of an adjustment period.<br><b>Mako:</b> Yeah, but it's great to have you back.<br><b>Korra:</b> There's no place else I'd rather be.<br><br><i>(Korra, Mako, and Asami share a group hug. The camera zooms out as Wu walks towards them to share the hug, but Korra pushes his face away. Wu manages to reach his arms out and touch them anyway.)</i><br><br><b>Wu:</b> Mmph. You guys are the greatest friends a guy could have.<br><br><i>(They break the group hug and Korra turns to Wu.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> So what are we gonna do with him? It's too dangerous to take him back to the hotel.<br><b>Wu:</b> Whoo. You're telling me! I need a cushy safe house somewhere.<br><b>Mako:</b> I think I know just the place.<br><br><i>(Scene changes. Dissolve into a high angle establishing shot of Asami's estate in the evening. Cut to Korra, Mako, Asami, and Wu at the front door.)</i><br><br><b>Wu:</b> Nice digs, Mako. You didn't tell me you came from money.<br><b>Mako:</b> I don't. This is Asami's place. She was nice enough to let my family stay here after they fled Ba Sing Se.<br><br><i>(Grandma Yin opens the door.)</i> <br><br><b>Yin:</b> Mako! It's so wonderful to- <i>(gasps)</i> are you...<br><br><i>(Cut to Yin's point of view as she looks at Wu, the focus becoming soft around him as he smiles at her.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Grandma, this is Prince Wu. He needs to stay with you and the family for a little while.<br><br><i>(Wu kneels down in front of Yin and takes her hand.)</i><br><br><b>Wu:</b> It's an honor, Grandma Mako.<br><br><i>(Wu kisses Yin's hand and she faints, Mako catching her.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> She loves royalty.<br><b>Wu:</b> I think I'll fit right in here. Thanks for looking out for me, Mako. Now where's the nearest bathroom? I have been holding it all day!<br><br><i>(Wu rushes inside, past the other family members. <br><br>Scene changes to Bolin, Varrick, Baraz and Ahnah on a dock by a small, rickity boat holding the rest of the escapees.)</i> <br><br><b>Bolin:</b> I know it might not mean much coming from a guy wearing this uniform, but I'd like to apologize for what Kuvira's put you through.<br><b>Baraz:</b> I appreciate that.<br><b>Bolin:</b> Guess this is where we part ways. <br><b>Varrick:</b> It's been a blast!<br><b>Ahnah:</b> We're heading North too. Why don't you come with us? It's the least we can do after you saved our necks.<br><b>Varrick:</b> On that hunk of junk? No thanks. I'm allergic to drowning. <i>(Bolin elbows his ribs)</i> Oof! I mean, uh, we'd love a lift! <br><br><i>(Varrick frowns as he and Bolin walk towards the boat. Bolin hops in while Varrick slowly steps in unsteadily, making the boat rock.)</i><br><br><b>Varrick:</b> Ew. Uh.<br><br><i>(Varrick falls in the boat, then stands back up, hands on his hips as Baraz and Ahnah join them. <br><br>The scene changes to a close up of a mallet driving a small spike into a tree root, connected to a meter with a wire. The dial on the meter goes to the max, and an electrical noise like a radio is heard. Cut to a shot of Baatar Jr. holding the meter while Kuvira stands behind him, both on top of a giant tree root.)</i><br><br><b>Baatar Jr.:</b> This area is overrun with spirit vines and they appear to be even more powerful than the samples we took from Republic City.<br><b>Kuvira:</b> Perfect. Harvest these vines until there's nothing left.<br><br><i>(Cut to a wider shot as Kuvira gestures to several mechatanks that are with them. Cut to a close up of a chainsaw extending from a mech's arm and spinning. Cut to a shot of the mechs sawing into the roots of the giant tree.

Then there was that time I covered the Nuktuk mover premiere. Boy, was that fun. But enough about me. Sit back, relax, and take a trip down memory lane.<br><br><br><br><b><u>Act I</u></b><br><br><i>(Jazz music plays and the episode opens up to a panshot of Asami's estate in the day with a flock of birds soaring above it.

But I hope you weren't as ambiguous with Korra as you were with Asami.<br><b>Mako:</b> Trust me, I wasn't. <i>(screen turns white and we are brought to a flashback of Mako running up to Korra after she leaves Katara's healing hut in "Endgame")</i> Korra and I ended up stopping Amon together and after that, I was finally able to tell her how I felt. Exactly how I felt.<br><br><i>(Flashback jumps to Mako confessing to Korra.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> I love you, Korra.<br><br><i>(The memory changes to Korra regaining the elements she lost and coming out of the Avatar State later in the "Endgame" episode. She spots Mako behind her and she runs up to him.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> I love you too.<br><br><i>(The couple kiss and the flashback pauses as Yin's and Mako's emojis appear near the bottom of the screen.)</i><br><br><b>Yin:</b> <i>(gushing over the cute scene)</i> Aww. And then you two lived happily ever after?<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(looks away uncertainly)</i> Um...<br><br><i>(Screen flashes white to a memory of Mako and Korra on the boat on their way to the Southern Water Tribe in "Rebel Spirit".)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Tenzin's just trying to help you become the best Avatar you can be.<br><b>Korra:</b> Of course you take his side.<br><b>Mako:</b> I'm not taking his side.<br><br><i>(Flashback switches to a scene from "The Southern Lights".)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> You know, sometimes I wonder whose side you're on.<br><b>Mako:</b> There aren't any sides.<br><br><i>(Scene changes to a memory of Mako and Korra arguing in the former's apartment in "Peacekeepers".)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> How could you take his side?<br><b>Mako:</b> What's with you and sides?<br><br><i>(The screen flashes white to another scene of the couple arguing in the same episode.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Well, excuse me, officer! Don't let me stand in the way of you writing tickets. I'm just trying to save the World!<br><br><i>(Screen flashes white once more to the scene of the couple confronting each other in the police station near the end of the episode.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Well, I guess that if we're both putting our jobs first, maybe there's no room for our relationship.<br><b>Korra:</b> So what? Are you breaking up with me?<br><b>Mako:</b> Yeah. I guess I am.<br><br><i>(The memory of Korra airbending Mako's desk is shown and the scene pauses there as Wu's emoji appears in the bottom right of the screen looking rather amused.)</i><br><br><b>Wu:</b> Now that's a breakup!<br><br><i>(A flashback of the beginning of "The Sting" is shown.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(continues to narrate)</i> After that, I dove into my work. Someone had been taking out supply ships heading to the Southern Water Tribe. <i>(scene changes to a memory of Mako and Asami on the ship during the sting operation)</i> Asami's company was one of the victims, so she and I worked together to catch the perps. The stakeout was the perfect way to get my mind off Korra. <i>(Mako and Asami are escaping from the ship in the flashback)</i> It was an intense night. Asami and I discovered the triads had double crossed us. We barely got away, <i>(the flashback changes to the empty Future Industries warehouse)</i> but by then Asami's warehouse had been cleared out.<br><br><i>(The memory continues to play on screen.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> My company... It's over. I give up.<br><b>Mako:</b> Well, I'm not giving up on you.<br><br><i>(Asami then kisses Mako in the flashback and it pauses there as Wu's and Mako's emojis pop up at the bottom of the screen.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> I know, I know. Don't tell me. I had no right kissing Asami.<br><b>Wu:</b> No, actually, I'm completely fine with that. You officially broke up with Korra and therefore, <i>(smiles)</i> you're free to smooch whoever you wish.<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(looks down uneasily)</i> If only it had been that simple.<br><br><i>(Screen flashes white and we are brought to a memory of Korra reuniting with Mako in the police station in "Night of a Thousand Stars".)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Mako, I missed you so much!<br><b>Mako:</b> Korra, hey, I missed you too. So you're not still mad at me? We had that fight before you left, remember?<br><b>Korra:</b> Not really. I got attacked by a Dark Spirit and I lost my memory for a little while. Maybe it hasn't all come back yet. Was it a bad fight?<br><b>Mako:</b> Ahh... Hmm... No. No. It wasn't that bad.<br><br><i>(The flashback pauses, Wu's and Mako's emojis pop into the screen once more. This time, Wu's emoji bubble is positioned diagonally above Mako's and the prince glares down at his bodyguard.)</i><br><br><b>Wu:</b> Whoa, whoa, whoa. So you were back with Asami, but then Korra came back and thought you guys were still together and you didn't tell her you weren't?!<br><br><i>(Yin's emoji pops up beside Mako, glaring at her grandson with disapproval.)</i><br><br><b>Yin:</b> Just like your grandfather.<br><b>Mako:</b> Well, me and Asami were never officially back together.<br><br><i>(Tu's emoji pops up beside Wu and he glares down at Mako.)</i><br><br><b>Tu:</b> Really? That again? <i>(Mako's expression changes to annoyance and embarrassment)</i> You know, it seems like you're so afraid to disappoint anyone that you end up disappointing everyone.<br><b>Wu:</b> Truer <i>(Mako's emoji glances up at Wu's)</i> words have never been spoken. High five!<br><br><i>(Tu and Wu extend their hands out of the emoji bubbles and high five. Once more, Mako has a "&gt;_&lt;" expression and he sticks his tongue out.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Well, eventually, I did tell Korra but by then she already knew.<br><br><i>(A flashback from "Light in the Dark" is played.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Why didn't you just tell me the truth in the first place?<br><b>Mako:</b> I know I should have, but... I didn't want to hurt you all over again. I guess part of me wanted to forget about the breakup too.<br><b>Korra:</b> I think we both know that this... Us... doesn't work.<br><b>Mako:</b> You're right.<br><b>Korra:</b> It's over. For real this time.<br><br><i>(Screen flashes to a memory of the ending of "Light in the Dark" where the camera pans up to the sky full of flying spirits.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> After Harmonic Convergence, the World changed. Team Avatar traveled around searching for new airbenders. <i>(the flashback changes to Mako behaving awkwardly between Asami and Korra in "A Breath of Fresh Air")</i> At first, it was awkward being around Korra and Asami.<br><br><i>(The memory continues to play out.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> As you were. Ladies.<br><br><i>(Mako narrates as a flashback of Korra persuading Mako to come with her in "Rebirth" is played.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> But then I realized I had to realize who I was without a lady in my life.<br><b>Wu:</b> <i>(narrates)</i> I know what that's like. <i>(scene returns back to the present where Mako and Wu are seated on the floor while Yin and Tu are standing off to the side and eavesdropping)</i> I mean, to need distance from women, because I have so many all over me, all the time.<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(cut to a close up of Mako who ignores Wu's statement)</i> Anyway, <i>(the screen flashes white to Mako and Ming-Hua fighting in "Venom of the Red Lotus")</i> I eventually helped Korra defeat Zaheer <i>(the flashback changes to Korra giving Mako a farewell hug in "Enter the Void")</i> and save the airbenders and we did it as friends. <i>(flashback changes to Korra standing up tall in the Tree of Time in "Light in the Dark")</i> Korra showed me the importance of putting others before myself. <i>(memory switches to Korra entering the Avatar State after she regained the elements in "Endgame")</i> And whenever I think of her, she continues to inspire me.<br><br><i>(Scene returns back to the present as Wu listens in awe.)</i><br><br><b>Wu:</b> Wow. <i>(pushes himself off the floor and stands up)</i> That story is amazing and I really learned something.<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(cut to a close up of Mako as he looks surprised)</i> You did? <i>(stands up as well)</i> Good.<br><br><i>(Camera angle changes to a full view of the room.)</i><br><br><b>Wu:</b> Yeah, I learned that I really didn't know anything about you. Crazy! Also, I realized that ladies are complicated. No offense, grandma.<br><b>Yin:</b> <i>(smiles)</i> None taken.<br><b>Wu:</b> I better just focus on being a better King. <i>(gets into a fighting stance)</i> Okay, come at me. <i>(Mako gets into position)</i> I can take it. <i>(Mako gently jabs Wu in the face and the prince falls flat on his back dramatically)</i> Ah! Wu down!<br><br><i>(Yin slaps Mako's arm and he looks at his grandmother with a shocked expression. Tu continues to slurp from his cup. Cut to commercial break.)</i><br><br><br><br><b><u>Act II</u></b><br><br><i>(Episode returns to a shot of the meditation pavilion on Air Temple Island in the evening. Cut to a close up of Korra seated on the railing and leaning against the pillar as she gazes out into ocean. A series of footsteps off-screen can be heard.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> I brought you some tea. <i>(Korra looks to the side and the camera pans left to reveal Asami with a cup of steaming tea in hand)</i> I thought you might be cold out here.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(slides off the railing)</i> You're so sweet. <i>(takes the cup of tea from Asami)</i> Thanks. <i>(Korra looks at the tea forlornly before putting it on the railing)</i><br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(concerned)</i> Are you okay? You seem out of sorts.<br><b>Korra:</b> Sorry. I've just been thinking about something Toph said. <i>(glances to Asami)</i> She told me that the World doesn't need me and it's basically pointless to try to stop Kuvira.<br><b>Asami:</b> That's ridiculous.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(looks down)</i> At the time, I thought so too. I figured she was just being her normal, cranky self, <i>(gazes up to the sky)</i> but I'm beginning to think she had a point.<br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(cut to a close up of Asami as she turns serious)</i> No, she doesn't. The World <i>does</i> need you. You're the Avatar.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(return back to a shot of Korra)</i> But no matter what I do, the World seems to always be out of balance. <i>(a flashback of Korra's firebending test in "Welcome to Republic City" starts to play)</i> Growing up, I couldn't wait to be the Avatar. I thought I was really gonna change things. I was so naive. <i>(the memory changes to Amon taking away Lightning Bolt Zolt's bending in "The Revelation")</i> The first time I saw Amon take someone's bending away, I was terrified.<br><br><i>(The scene from that memory plays out.)</i><br><br><b>Amon:</b> Your firebending is gone. Forever.<br><br><i>(The flashback changes to the moment where Amon bloodbends Korra into a position to take her bending away in "Endgame")</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(narrates)</i> Then my worst nightmare came true.<br><br><i>(That painful memory continues playing out on screen.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Korra!<br><b>Korra:</b> No! <i>(gasps)</i><br><b>Amon:</b> I told you I would destroy you.<br><br><i>(The scene flashes to the later part of the episode where Amon, now with his face paint washed away, waterbending a spout just outside the probending arena with various onlookers witnessing the scene.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(narrates)</i> Korra, you're forgetting about all the good that happened after you exposed Amon as the fraud he was. The Equalist movement lost its leader <i>and</i> its power. <i>(a scene of Raiko and Buttercup waving to the crowd from a podium is shown)</i> Free elections were held in the United Republic and non-benders <i>finally</i> had a voice. <i>(the memory of Korra shaking hands with Raiko from "Peacekeepers" also plays)</i> People had hope again and it was all because of you.<br><br><i>(Switch to a memory of Korra smiling fondly at her friends at the end of "Endgame".)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(narrates)</i> And I was hopeful too. <i>(the flashback changes to Korra meeting her uncle in the throne room in "Civil Wars, Part 1")</i> But that feeling didn't last long. <i>(the memory of Korra finally seeing her uncle's true motives from "A New Spiritual Age" is played)</i> As soon as I defeated Amon, a new enemy took his place.<br><br><i>(The scene continues to play out.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> I can't believe I trusted you. You made me think you wanted to restore balance with the spirits, but this- this isn't balance. It's madness! Now let her go!<br><b>Unalaq:</b> If you want your friend to make it out of the Spirit World, you'll open the other portal now.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(narrates as the memory of Korra opening the Northern portal plays out on screen)</i> Because of Unalaq, I betrayed Tenzin, opened the portals, and threw the sprit and human worlds into chaos. <br><br><i>(A flashback of Vaatu being released from his prison from "Harmonic Convergence" plays out.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> It was my fault he fused with Vaatu <i>(the scene where Unalaq rips Raava out of Korra from "Darkness Falls" plays on the screen)</i> and became a Dark Avatar. <br><br><i>(The scene of Unalaq beating Raava into shreds later in that episode is shown on screen.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(narrates)</i> And I was helpless to stop him from destroying Raava and cutting off my connection to my past lives. <i>(a memory of the line up of Avatars disappearing plays out on screen)</i> With Raava gone, <i>(a scene of UnaVaatu merging and growing in size is shown)</i> Unalaq and Vaatu became more powerful than ever.<br><br><i>(The flashback of UnaVaatu attacking Republic City from "Light in the Dark" plays.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(narrates)</i> But you became more powerful too. <i>(the memory of Giant Korra emerging from the Tree of Time from the same episode plays out on screen)</i> I mean, you turned into a giant spirit.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(comments softly)</i> Yeah, that was pretty awesome.<br><br><i>(A flashback of Korra opening the Southern Portal in "The Southern Lights" is shown.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(narrates encouragingly)</i> And opening the spirit portals turned out to be a good thing. <i>(the scene of all the new airbenders standing up in "Original Airbenders" is shown)</i> You brought back the airbenders and <i>(the screen flashes to Jinora's anointment ceremony at the end of "Venom of the Red Lotus")</i> caused a positive shift in the World.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(continues to narrate and the memory of Zaheer flying away with an unconscious Korra from "Enter the Void" is shown)</i> Yes, but Zaheer got airbending too, and nearly killed me. <br><br><i>(The flashback of Korra hitting the ground and Zaheer suffocating her in "Venom of the Red Lotus" plays out. The flashback then changes to Zaheer murdering Queen Hou-Ting in "Long Live the Queen".)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> If it weren't for Zaheer, the Earth Queen would still be alive. There would have been no crisis in the Earth Kingdom, <i>(the flashback of Kuvira negotiating with the bandits from "After All These Years" plays out)</i> and Kuvira wouldn't be in power. <i>(a flashback of Kuvira's army lining up outside Zaofu in "The Battle of Zaofu" is shown)</i> Things are more out of balance than ever now. Nothing's changed!<br><br><i>(Camera flashes back to the present and Tenzin is shown to be standing behind Asami and Korra in the meditation pavilion.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> You're right, Korra.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(shocked)</i> I am?<br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(doubtful)</i> She is?<br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(takes a step towards his student)</i> It's true, there will always be new conflicts and enemies to face. But the important thing is to <i>learn</i> from your enemies and better yourself over time, which you have. <i>(a flashback of Korra fighting against and destroying the wind gates in "A Leaf in the Wind" is shown)</i> You've changed so much since you first arrived on Air Temple Island. When you first came here, you were hotheaded and a bit selfish. <i>(the memory of Korra talking to Daw on Kyoshi bridge in "After All These Years" is shown as well)</i> But you've matured into a thoughtful young woman who puts the needs of others before herself. <i>(the flashback changes to the airbenders lining up in the ceremonial hall for Jinora's anointment ceremony in "Venom of the Red Lotus")</i> The New Air Nation is a testament to that. You sacrificed everything to save them. <i>(a scene of citizens enjoying their time in Avatar Korra Park from "After All These Years" plays out on screen)</i> You're an inspiration to the World.<br><br><i>(Cut back to the present and we see a close up of Korra, touched by her mentor's words.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Thank you both. <i>(looks away)</i> I know that this Kuvira problem is only going to get worse. <i>(switch a shot of the trio as Korra looks out into ocean)</i> But no matter what happens, <i>(Tenzin and Asami follow her gaze)</i> no matter how crazy things get, <i>(camera pans out to the beautiful sunset, with the rays reflecting off the waters)</i> I'll always try to restore balance.<br><br><i>(Wistful music plays and the episode cuts to commercial break.)</i><br><br><br><br><b><u>Act III</u></b><br><br><i>(Episode returns to a shot of a boat sailing the seas at night.)</i><br><br><b>Baraz:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> And that's when I made a solemn vow never to eat bark-onion soup again. <i>(cut to a close up of Baraz and Ahnah as the former tells his story)</i> Been six years, four months, and fourteen days- <i>(shudders)</i> Ugh. I can still taste it.<br><br><i>(Switch to an overshot of the boat where the prisoners, Varrick, and Bolin are seated in a circle on the deck. Most of the prisoners are asleep.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Does anyone else feel like throwing themselves overboard?<br><b>Varrick:</b> <i>(raises his voice slightly)</i> Not me! <i>(the prisoners suddenly wake up and look at him)</i> I've spent the last few hours tuning out all these incredibly boring stories...<br><b>Baraz:</b> Hey!<br><b>Varrick:</b> All the while <i>(stands up)</i> mentally composing <i>(poses dramatically with a finger in the air)</i> the most exciting tale <i>(bends down to Bolin's level excitedly)</i> ever told, <i>(jumps into the middle of the circle)</i> soon to become the greatest mover ever made! <i>(cut to a close up of Varrick)</i> I present to you now: <i>(uses his arms to form a circle around Bolin who is in the background)</i> Bolin, <i>(the screen flashes white to a title card of Nuktuk, Hero of the South from "The Sting")</i> as Nuktuk, Hero of the South- <i>(an emoji bubble of Varrick appears in the bottom right corner of the screen)</i> Trademark Varrimovers International- <i>(raises his brows with sheer enthusiasm)</i> In the <i>(a memory of Bolin fighting off the kidnappers in "Night of a Thousand Stars" is shown)</i> incredible true story of Bolin! Hero of the World!<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(narrates off-screen)</i> Wait, am I playing Nuktuk, or is Nuktuk playing me?<br><br><i>(Return back to the present and Varrick is seen forming his fingers into the shape of a rectangle frame and he scrutinizes Bolin through it.)</i><br><br><b>Varrick:</b> Both. It's your true story, but we'll capitalize on the audience of the Nuktuk franchise. Duh.<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(cut to a close up of Bolin)</i> How can you call me the Hero of the World? <i>(looks down despondently)</i> I left my friends and family to join up with a psychotic dictator who imprisoned me, and now I'm running back home with my tail between my legs.<br><br><i>(Switch to a full shot of the deck.)</i><br><br><b>Varrick:</b> Nya, ba, ba, ba, ba. You're emphasizing the wrong story beats. Let me tell it. The story of Bolin begins in an exotic <i>(screen flashes white to a panning shot of the Southern Water Tribe from "Rebel Spirit")</i> port of call. A wise sage, the richest merchant in the World, and a handsome devil all sit <i>(the flashback moves to a shot of Varrick's yacht)</i> on a single pillow in the living room of a luxury yacht. How do they all fit on one pillow?<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(answers excitedly off-screen)</i> Ooh! <i>(the memory changes to Varrick seated on a pillow inside his yacht)</i> Giant pillow!<br><b>Varrick:</b> <i>(continues narrating off-screen)</i> Wrong! They're all the same man! Me! I try to teach a Swami the power of levitation, but he's too stupid to understand it, so I kick him out. "Upon whom can I bestow my awesome knowledge?" I ask myself. <i>(the flashback changes to Bolin and Asami walking into Varrick's yacht)</i> Then in walks Nuktuk with a twinkle in his eye, a gorgeous dame on his arm, and a song on his lips. He bursts into a rapturous melody- <i>(the flashback pauses at the moment when Bolin opens his mouth inside the yacht)</i> "Where can I find <i>(the flashback pans across Varrick and his guests in the yacht)</i> my teacher?"<br><br><i>(Camera returns back to the present where Varrick has a hand on his chest and his other arm is outstretched as he is sings.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(stands up in disbelief)</i> Oh, come on! <i>(annoyed)</i> I wasn't singing, <i>(points to Varrick)</i> you were not levitating. And Asami is just a friend, thank you very much. <i>(the camera slowly zooms in on Bolin)</i> If you want to tell my true story, you should start from when I met Korra. <i>(camera switches to a flashback of Korra seeing the probending ring for the first time up close and personal in "A Leaf in the Wind")</i> She came to the bending arena one fateful night...<br><br><i>(The memory continues to play.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> This place is even more amazing than I imagined!<br><b>Bolin:</b> Name's Bolin, by the way.<br><b>Korra:</b> Korra.<br><b>Baraz:</b> <i>(the flashback pauses)</i> Boring! <i>(return back to the present with an overhead shot of the deck)</i> When does the singing start?<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(crossly)</i> There wasn't any singing!<br><b>All on boat:</b> <i>(simultaneously booing)</i> Boo!<br><br><i>(Bolin reels back in shock and we cut to a close up of him looking confused by everyone's reactions.)</i><br><br><b>Varrick:</b> <i>(looks to Bolin)</i> You're onscreen talent, kid. Leave the storytelling to the masters. <i>(a memory of Korra and Jinora seemingly eaten by a crocodile-like spirit in "A New Spiritual Age" plays)</i> So the trouble begins when the Avatar is trapped in the Spirit World. <i>(a shot of Korra falling off from a waterfall plays on the screen)</i> The World's most evil villains realize that with Korra out of the way, the time is right to try <i>(the flashback suddenly changes to Bolin flexing his muscles as Nuktuk)</i> to take out Bolin. <i>(a shot of the Evil Unalaq's fortress as seen in the mover from "The Sting" is shown)</i> So the worst of the worst team up. They're led by <i>(a shot of Zaheer flying in "Venom of the Red Lotus" is played on the screen)</i> Zaheer- Leader of Red Lotus and Master of the Skies! <i>(the memories begin to show Korra and Zaheer fighting in "Enter the Void" and "Venom of the Red Lotus")</i> A flying chaotic chaos machine! He's joined by <i>(a flashback of Vaatu flying out of The Tree of Time in "Harmonic Convergence" is shown)</i> Vaatu- The ultimate force of pure spirit evil in the universe! The biggest, meanest, scariest kite that ever flew! <br><br><i>(Scenes of Vaatu avoiding Korra's elemental attacks from "Darkness Falls" plays on screen.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(narrates off-screen in disbelief)</i> Wait, Zaheer didn't team up with Vaatu. How would that even happen?<br><b>Varrick:</b> How do you think? <br><br><i>(A shot of The Tree of Time is shown and we can hear a phone ringing. Cut to a close up of Vaatu imprisoned inside the tree and he is  now holding a candlestick telephone with his spirity tendrils. The receiver is held near the top of his head while the transmitter is held towards his "eye".)</i><br><br><b>Vaatu:</b> Hello?<br><b>Zaheer:</b> <i>(off-screen, over the phone)</i> Hey, it's Zaheer.<br><b>Vaatu:</b> Oh, hey, Zaheer.<br><br><i>(The screen splits into two to reveal a shot of Zaheer talking on the radio in the Northern Air Temple from "Enter the Void". The animation of his mouth is slightly different from the actual episode as he appears to smiling and chuckling.)</i><br><br><b>Zaheer:</b> Glad I caught you at home. <i>(laughs)</i><br><b>Vaatu:</b> Uh-huh. Very funny. Like I can leave this stupid tree.<br><b>Zaheer:</b> Hold on. Let me conference in-<br><br><i>(A flashback of Amon appearing on stage in "The Revelation" is shown.)</i><br><br><b>Varrick:</b> <i>(narrates off-screen)</i> Amon! The reanimated zombie body <i>(the memory suddenly changes to Amon bloodbending Korra and Mako in "Endgame")</i> of the bloodbending leader of the equalists!<br><br><i>(The screen suddenly returns to the conference call and the screen splits into three as Amon enters the frame. They are using an image of Amon talking into the microphone on stage from "The Revelation" episode.)</i><br><br><b>Amon:</b> Hey, guys, I'm totally in for taking out Bolin. He's way too powerful and awesome. But can we please not include-<br><br><i>(The screen suddenly splits into four as a black and white image of Evil Unalaq from the Nuktuk mover enters the frame, turning around to face the audience and talking into a phone's receiver.)</i><br><br><b>Evil Unalaq:</b> Not include who, Amon?<br><b>Varrick:</b> <i>(continues to narrate off-screen)</i> The Evil Unalaq! The diabolical but incredibly boring and unpopular sorcerer from the North, who's listening in on the other line!<br><b>Evil Unalaq:</b> <i>(the camera zooms in on Evil Unalaq)</i> I've spent my life trying to defeat Nuktuk, I mean, Bolin, and I know just where to find him- with all the beautiful ladies.<br><br><i>(The flashback of Ginger enthusiastically kissing Bolin in front of the cameras in "Night of a Thousand Stars" is played on screen.)</i><br><br><b>Varrick:</b> <i>(narrates off-screen)</i> Yes, Bolin had a reputation as the World's greatest <i>(the flashback changes to Eska kissing Bolin in "Darkness Falls")</i> ladies' man.<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(comments off-screen)</i> Ooh, now the story's getting interesting.<br><b>Varrick:</b> <i>(continues to narrate as a shot of Eska and Bolin meeting for the first time in "Rebel Spirit" is shown)</i> After leaving the beautiful but emotionally unstable Water Tribe princess <i>(a shot of Eska angrily chasing after Varrick's boat in "Civil Wars, Part 2" plays on the screen)</i> at the altar, he met <i>(the memory changes to Bolin meeting Opal in "The Metal Clan")</i> a fetching airbender, the heir to a vast Earth Kingdom fortune.<br><br><i>(An lovesick emoji bubble of Bolin appears in the bottom right corner of the screen.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Opal, so smart and caring. So pretty to smell... <i>(a flashback of Opal pushing Bolin away in "After All These Years" plays as Bolin's emoji starts bawling tearfully)</i> And she'll probably never talk to me again because I'm so stupid! Stupid! So, so, so stupid!<br><br><i>(Varrick's emoji pops up beside Bolin and he glares at Bolin's emoji.)</i><br><br><b>Varrick:</b> Pull it together, you leaky lug. <i>(return back to the present as Varrick gets all excited)</i> But the darkest moment is always right before the dawn. For at his lowest point, Bolin sought advice from the man who started it all, the wisest of the wise- <i>(screen flashes white to a memory of Varrick talking to Bolin in the beginning of "Peacekeepers")</i> me! For some of my signature sage advice! <i>(the flashback changes to Varrick hanging upside down during his idea storm in "Peacekeepers")</i> Nuktuk, I mean, Bolin, there's only one thing for you to do <i>(switch to a close up of Varrick's reddened face as his mouth opens and closes in sync to Varrick's current narration)</i> if you want to save the Avatar and defeat the Fearsome Foursome. <i>(the flashback pauses and Varrick's emoji pops up in the bottom right corner)</i> I'm not really sure if I like "fearsome." I mean, Evil Square might be better. Whatever. <i>(the emoji disappears and Varrick continues his narration)</i> You have to assemble the fightingest airbender army of all time! <i>(a memory of the new airbenders going through the obstacle course in "Original Airbenders" plays on the screen)</i> But it turns out the airbender recruits are a sorry lot, so Bolin brings them to a secret mountaintop training facility where he teaches them the ancient art of dodging fruit and balancing on sticks! Meanwhile, back with Zombie Amon...<br><br><i>(Screen changes to a three-way split screen conference call between Amon, Vaatu, and Zaheer.)</i><br><br><b>Amon:</b> Okay, guys, I think we finally ditched him.<br><b>Evil Unalaq:</b> <i>(slides into frame)</i> Ha ha. Very funny. I'm still on the line. So about that evil plan to destroy Nuktuk... <i>(the frames of Zaheer, Vaatu, and Amon quickly slide off-screen, leaving Evil Unalaq alone on his throne with his bodyguards by his side)</i> Hello?

Weeks ago, Korra removed the remaining poison from her body, but the memory of Zaheer's attack still torments her. And after being defeated by Kuvira, she questions if she will ever fully recover. Meanwhile, Kuvira has been secretly harvesting spirit vines from The Swamp. But how close is she to completing her spirit energy weapon?<br><br><br><br><b><u>Act I</u></b> <br><br><i>(Episode opens up to a shot of the Spirit Wilds of Republic City. Camera pans down to small tourist group gathered around Ryu past the entrance gate of the tourist attraction. There are various people either taking pictures or buying tickets.)</i><br><br><b>Ryu:</b> Everyone, Mom, can we stay together, please? The tour's about to begin.<br><br><i>(Camera zooms in on Ryu in his new airbender suit and his parents. Ryu now sports dyed blonde hair.)</i><br><br><b>Ryu's Mom:</b> <i>(to a couple of tourists standing off to the side)</i> That's my boy- Ryu. He used to live in the basement, but then he got airbending, and <i>(places a hand on her son's shoulder)</i> he's been doing important <i>(a camera flash goes off in the foreground)</i> Air Nation stuff all over the World. <i>(chuckles)</i> His father and I are here visiting him, <i>(Ryu is checking through his cue cards)</i> and we're just having the best time in the big city. <i>(places both hands on her son's arm)</i> We're so proud, <i>(to her husband)</i> right, honey?<br><b>Ryu's Dad:</b> <i>(shrugs)</i> At least he has a job now.<br><b>Ryu:</b> <i>(shrugs off his mother's hands)</i> Mom, Dad, I'm trying to work.<br><br><i>(Scene changes to the ruined buildings of the city that is now overrun by vines. The tourists stop to take pictures in front of a vine covered structure.)</i> <br><br><b>Ryu:</b> <i>(reading off the cards in a bored manner)</i> Fun fact, everyone: All these vines were created by UnaVaatu when he battled Giant Spirit Korra <i>(gestures to the area behind him)</i> for the fate of the World. <i>(he looks a little annoyed that no one is paying attention to him)</i><br><br><i>(Cut to Ryu's point of view looking at the tourists as one of them turns around to address him.)</i><br><br><b>Tourist #1:</b> <i>(with dull enthusiasm)</i> Excuse me. Are we in the Spirit World right now?<br><b>Ryu:</b> <i>(cut to a close up of Ryu as he sighs)</i> No.<br><b>Tourist #1:</b> <i>(walks into frame as he takes pictures of the ground)</i> Is the Spirit World in the ground below us? <i>(the flashes of his camera goes off a couple more times)</i><br><b>Ryu:</b> No, can I just get through my cards?<br><b>Ryu's Mom:</b> <i>(enters the frame)</i> Oh, honey, don't get flustered.<br><b>Ryu:</b> I'm not!<br><b>Tourist #1:</b> <i>(looks up from his camera with eyes wide open)</i> Uh, why is that vine coming toward us?<br><br><i>(Switch to a view from behind the trio as we see a vine slithering in their direction. A scare cord plays and we cut to a frontal shot of them as the vine gets closer. The rest of the tourists turn their attention to the vine and continue to take pictures.)</i><br><br><b>Ryu:</b> <i>(panicks slightly)</i> Uh, <i>(flips through his cue cards)</i> I don't see anything about that on the cards.<br><br><i>(Cut to a profile shot of the scene as the tourist bends down to pick up a branch.)</i><br><br><b>Tourist #1:</b> I'm gonna poke it <i>(runs off-screen)</i> with a stick.<br><b>Ryu:</b> <i>(exasperated)</i> No! why would you do that?<br><br><i>(Switch to a shot of tourist #1 as he pokes the vine a couple of times and the vine reacts by knocking the stick out of his grasp.)</i><br><br><b>Tourist #1:</b> <i>(shrieks)</i> Ah! <i>(the vine wraps around the tourist's waist and lifts him off the ground)</i> Ooh! Oh! <i>(the vine pulls him higher into the air and the tourist's hat falls off his head)</i> Oh!<br><br><i>(Return back to Ryu with a protective hand raised behind him.)</i><br><br><b>Ryu:</b> Everyone back! <i>(discards his cards and runs off-screen)</i><br><b>Ryu's Mom:</b> This tour is exciting! <br><br><i>(Switch back to the tourist in the vine's hold as Ryu does an airbending "slice" but his attack collides against the vine without doing any damage. Cut back to the tourists as they continue to take pictures but unbeknownst to them, the vines quickly sneak in from the sides and wrap around their torsos, lifting them off the ground.)</i><br><br><b>Ryu's Mom:</b> <i>(oblivious to everything that is occurring behind her)</i> Isn't he the best airbender <i>(turns around)</i> ever- <i>(a vine wraps around her calf and lifts her upside down)</i> Ahh!<br><br><i>(Cut to Ryu who turns around to see his mother get grabbed but he too, gets swaddled by another vine. Tourist #1 drops his camera and it crashes on the ground, shattering the flash bulb and bits of the camera's metallic body.<br><br>Location changes to Korra seated on the steps in front of a building on Air Temple Island. She casually earthbends little columns of earth up and down from the ground and Naga chases after them like "whack a mole". Switch to a view from behind Korra's back as Opal walks towards them. Cut to a close up of Korra's face as she looks worried. Switch to a shot of Opal with her arms crossed and pouting sadly. Korra enters the frame.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Everything okay?<br><b>Opal:</b> <i>(looks to the side)</i> No. Kuvira has my family, <i>(waves an arm out irritably)</i> and no one seems to care but me.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(rests a hand on Opal's shoulder)</i> We all care. Don't worry. We'll get them back safely.<br><br><i>(Camera abruptly cuts to the sky as Jinora flies down towards them and does a somersault, landing on the ground. She closes the wings on her suit as she runs towards the older girls.)</i><br><br><b>Jinora:</b> Guys, there you are! I just felt a weird surge of spiritual energy coming from the Spirit Wilds. <i>(cut to a close up of Korra and Opal as they look concerned)</i> Something's wrong. <i>(Korra frowns worriedly)</i><br><br><i>(Location changes to the Spirit Wilds and we can see a foot entering the frame, walking around.)</i><br><br><b>Opal:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> Are you sure you felt a disturbance? <i>(cut to a shot of Opal searching through the area while Jinora searches the ruins in the background)</i> Maybe you just had some bad food for breakfast.<br><b>Jinora:</b> I'm telling you. I felt it. Maybe something happened to Ryu's tour group. <i>(takes a few steps forward)</i> We should've run into them by now.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(enters the frame and stands beside Opal)</i> Yeah, but it's Ryu. They might be at the mall for all we know.<br><b>Jinora:</b> Korra, <i>(both girls turn towards her)</i> can't you feel how strange the energy is?<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(turns away)</i> No, but... <i>(cut to a close up of Korra looking down at a vine)</i> Maybe I can get a reading.<br><br><i>(Korra closes her eyes and lays a hand on the vine which glows golden from her touch. Cut to her point of view as she travels down the vines and when we reach the end of the tunnel, Korra sees a vision of Kuvira's mechatanks standing on the roots of the Banyan Tree Grove and two of the tanks are pulling on a canister with a vine already encased inside. View pans across two mechatanks sawing through the roots of the tree but the root reacts by wrapping its vine around one of the tanks, swinging it around. A couple of cables are bent off-screen, surrounding the vine and the camera pans to a mechatank leaning backwards as it tugs on the cables. The vision changes to another mechatank sawing through another vine. Return back to Korra as she gasps and quickly removes her hand from the vine.)</i><br><br><b>Opal:</b> Korra, <i>(grabs Korra's arm)</i> what is it? Are you okay?<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(turns around)</i> It was Kuvira. I saw her taking vines from The Swamp. It must be affecting our Spirit Wilds. <i>(to Jinora)</i> I bet that's what you were sensing, Jinora.<br><b>Jinora:</b> <i>(concerned)</i> Why is she taking vines?<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(frowns)</i> Whatever the reason, I'm sure it's not good.<br><b>Opal:</b> We have to tell Raiko. This might help him convince the other leaders to finally take her down.<br><b>Jinora:</b> I'll keep looking for Ryu and the others.<br><br><i>(Cut to an overhead shot of the girls as they go their separate ways.<br><br>Scene changes to a shot of a vine-covered City Hall.)</i><br><br><b>Raiko:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> I say we deal with this Kuvira situation immediately.<br><br><i>(Cut to the inside of City Hall with the Fire Lord, Raiko, Tenzin, and Wu seated around the council table. Mako, Lin, and Raiko's bodyguards keep watch.)</i><br><br><b>Wu:</b> Yes! Agreed! And I know just how to get rid of her: <i>(cut to a frontal shot of an enthusiastic Wu)</i> We tell her she won an all-expense-paid vacation to a tropical island. Then when she gets there, we reveal it was a trap- the island's a prison! Boom! Got her! <br><br><i>(Cut to Tenzin as he raises an eyebrow. Return back to a profile shot of Wu.)</i><br><br><b>Wu:</b> Or, <i>(chuckles)</i> okay, uh, I'm just spitballing here. <i>(to Raiko who rests his chin on his hands, deep in thought)</i>  We march in with an army of highly trained badgermoles! <br><br><i>(He looks towards the camera as he blinks his eyes excitedly. Cut to a close up of the Fire Lord as she narrows her eyes at the prince. Return back to a shot of Wu.)</i><br><br><b>Wu:</b> Do we know if Kuvira has any allergies?<br><b>Raiko:</b> <i>(rests his hands on the table)</i> Look, I think we all know what must be done. We take the fight to her.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(cut to a close up of Tenzin as he speaks)</i> I don't believe attacking is the right move, since she hasn't done anything aggressive toward the United Republic.<br><b>Lin:</b> Not yet. <i>(camera pans up and left to Lin)</i> But Kuvira can't be trusted. She told us that she was going to turn over power, and she didn't. I'm with Raiko. <i>(switch to a full shot of the table)</i> I say we go on the offensive and start by retaking Zaofu.<br><br><i>(The doors unlock and open off-screen.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(enters the frame)</i> President Raiko, <i>(cut to a close up of Korra with Opal behind her)</i> I'm sorry to interrupt, but- <i>(pauses in her steps, confused)</i> what's going on here?<br><br><i>(Switch to a shot of Wu as he leans back in his chair suavely.)</i><br><br><b>Wu:</b> Oh, hey, Avatar Korra. <i>(stretches his fingers)</i> Just kickin' it World leader style, trying to figure out what to do about Kuvira. For the record, I told Raiko <i>(camera pans right to Raiko)</i> he should've invited you.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(cut to Korra as she looks visibly annoyed)</i> You invited him but not me?<br><b>Tenzin:</b> <i>(switch to a close up of Tenzin as he calms her down)</i> Please, Korra, it's not personal. We just thought perhaps we called you back into action a little too soon.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(return back to Korra who is still irked)</i> Again- <i>(stretches an arm out towards Wu)</i> him, not me?<br><b>Raiko:</b> <i>(cut to Raiko as he stands up)</i> Korra, we're in the middle of a meeting, and we can't have people just barge in whenever they want!<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> Guys! <i>(switch to Bolin and Varrick running into City Hall)</i> Oh, perfect! You're all here! <br><br><i>(Bolin drops his hands on his knees and pants before giving a sheepish wave. Cut to a Korra, Mako, and Opal.)</i><br><br><b>Mako and Opal:</b> <i>(simulataneously)</i> Bolin? <i>(Korra grins widely)</i><br><br><i>(Switch back to Raiko as he doesn't look pleased.)</i><br><br><b>Raiko:</b> What are you doing here?! Guards, <i>(footsteps are heard off-screen)</i> remove these traitors!<br><br><i>(Cut back to Bolin and Varrick as they get restrained by the guards.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> No! We escaped Kuvira's army! We're back on your side now! <i>(cut to a close up of Bolin's face as he hollers while he gets dragged away)</i> We have top secret information for you!<br><br><i>(Camera cuts to Tenzin and Wu who are surprised by the revelation. Camera pans right to Raiko and he gives a nod. Switch back to Bolin and Varrick as the guards release them.)</i><br><br><b>Varrick:</b> <i>(pats the dust off his uniform)</i> Okay, I guess we should have opened with that line.<br><b>Bolin:</b> Listen to me. Kuvira is making this thing that goes... <i>(imitates explosion and yells)</i> I don't know how it works, but it has this... <i>(warbling)</i><br><b>Varrick:</b> <i>(steps forward and rests a hand on Bolin's shoulder)</i> It's a super weapon! Like a regular weapon, only super!<br><br><i>(Switch to a profile shot of Varrick with Mako, Korra, and Opal off to the side.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(frowns)</i> And let me guess. It has something to do with spirit vines.<br><b>Varrick:</b> Yes! How did you know?<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(to the council)</i> I saw a vision of her taking spirit vines from The Swamp.<br><b>Varrick:</b> <i>(camera changes to a slight aerial shot of the scene)</i> If she figures out how to harness their power, we are <i>all</i> doomed.<br><b>Raiko:</b> She might use the weapon to attack Republic City. The only way to protect ourselves <i>(points a finger down on the table)</i> is with a preemptive strike.<br><b>Tenzin:</b> My airbenders won't be part of an unprovoked attack.<br><b>Fire Lord Izumi:</b> <i>(stands up)</i> Neither will <i>(cut to a close up of the Fire Lord as she speaks coolly)</i> the Fire Nation.<br><br><i>(Camera cuts to a full shot of the table.)</i><br><br><b>Raiko:</b> But, Fire Lord Izumi, Kuvira is a <i>threat</i> to the World. She has to be stopped!<br><b>Fire Lord Izumi:</b> <i>(cut back to Izumi as she talks calmly)</i> The Fire Nation has spent too much <i>(closes her eyes)</i> of its history fighting <i>nonsense</i> wars, <i>(opens her eyes and glares at Raiko)</i> and I refuse to drag my nation into another one <i>(furrows her brows)</i> unless there's no other choice. <i>(return back to a full shot of the table)</i> <i>If</i> you attack Kuvira, you'll do it <i>without</i> my army.<br><b>Raiko:</b> <i>(adjusts his glasses)</i> Fine. I'll hold off any plans of attack. We'll go on the defensive and fortify security on the borders.<br><b>Fire Lord Izumi:</b> <i>(return back to Izumi)</i> In that, <i>(smiles softly)</i> you'll have my help.<br><br><i>(Scene changes to the outside of City Hall as Opal leaves through the doors. Bolin runs out and quickly catches up to her.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Opal, wait! <i>(stops in front of Opal and she looks down angrily)</i> Please, I just want to say that I'm sorry for everything.<br><b>Opal:</b> <i>(crosses her arms)</i> I'm glad you're okay, but it's a little late for sorry.<br><b>Opal:</b> I know, I know. <i>(cut to a frontal shot of Bolin as he shoots his mouth off)</i> I didn't listen to you, and I sided with Kuvira, and I helped her take over the Earth Kingdom and topple your home and get your Mom captured <i>(switch to a shot of Opal who looks irked)</i> and your brothers and your Dad... <i>(return back to a shot of Bolin)</i> Wow, that does sound really bad when I say it out loud like that. But I'm gonna make it up to you.<br><br><i>(Cut to a full shot of the duo as Lin walks up to them.)</i><br><br><b>Lin:</b> Pardon me, lovebirds, but I need a word with Opal. <i>(Opal walks off and Bolin starts to follow but Lin raises a hand up to stop him)</i> Privately. <i>(walks off with her niece)</i><br><br><i>(Switch to Opal and her aunt walking up to a pillar.)</i><br><br><b>Lin:</b> I'm sorry, kid, but Raiko couldn't convince the other leaders to attack Kuvira.<br><b>Opal:</b> <i>(worriedly)</i> So our family...<br><b>Lin:</b> Looks like we're going to have to save them ourselves.<br><b>Opal:</b> Don't you think some other people would agree to go with us?<br><b>Lin:</b> <i>(cut to a close up of Lin as she turns serious)</i> This is an unsanctioned and dangerous mission into enemy territory. We can't ask other people to risk their necks for our family. If we want to break them out, we'll have to do it alone.<br><br><i>(Camera pans left to reveal Bolin leaning against a pillar a few columns away. Mako and Korra walk up to him.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Bolin, I'm so glad you're back. <i>(cut to a close up of the trio)</i> I was worried about you. <i>(Mako gives Bolin a hug)</i><br><b>Korra:</b> We all were. <i>(all three of them share a group hug)</i><br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(pulls away after a moment and looks down sadly)</i> Thanks, guys. Mako, I'm so sorry about the way we left things. <i>(sighs)</i> I'm such an idiot. You tried to warn me about Kuvira, and I ran off anyway, like an idiot. You were right, and I'm just an idiot. I hope that I'll be able to earn your trust again.<br><b>Korra:</b> If anyone has lost people's trust, <i>(gestures to herself)</i> it's me. Ever since Kuvira kicked my butt, no one even wants me around.<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(rests a hand on Korra's shoulder)</i> We want you around. <i>(removes his hand from Korra's shoulder and gestures to his brother)</i> And, Bolin, you're not an idiot. <i>(switch to an overhead shot of the scene)</i> You were just doing what you thought was right.<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(touched)</i> Aw, I love you guys. And I really want to hug again.<br><br><i>(Bolin walks towards his brother and friend and all three of them embrace once more.<br><br>Scene changes to Jinora walking around the Spirit Wilds. She comes across a fallen, broken camera on the ground and picks it up, investigating the object. As she does so, a vine slithers in the background, catching her attention. She puts the camera down and airbends herself off the ground before the vine manages to grab her. Jinora lands on top of a roof but the vine creeps up the building and attempts to swipe her.<br><br>The young master runs forward and opens the wings of her glider suit and flies off the roof, narrowly escaping a couple more vines that violently slam against the roof. The vine chases after her and we cut to a frontal shot of Jinora as she flies closer to the ground to avoid more of the vine's onslaught. Cut to a close up of Jinora as she looks up and gasps.)</i><br><br><b>Jinora:</b> <i>(ducks to avoid a vine)</i> Agh!<br><br><i>(Switch to full shot of Jinora descending down to the ground at a fast pace but she opens up the wings of her glider suit to propel herself back up before flying off-screen. Three tendrils of vines chase after her and coil around her legs.)</i><br><br><b>Jinora:</b> Ugh! <i>(the vines pull her away)</i> Ahh!<br><br><i>(Cut to a shot of Jinora being flung around by the vines and brought to the ground as more vines encase her.)</i><br><br><b>Jinora:</b> Argh!<br><br><i>(The young master closes her eyes and meditates. The camera zooms in on her face and the camera flashes white to a shot of Korra and Mako standing in front of City Hall. Jinora's blue apparition in front of them, startling Mako. Switch to a shot from behind the couple's backs looking up at Jinora.)</i><br><br><b>Jinora:</b> Korra! The vines! They're taking me! <i>(curls her body)</i> Help!<br><br><i>(Cut to a close up of Korra and Mako who are shocked by the news and they look at each other to think of a plan. Cut to commercial break.)</i><br><br><br><br><b><u>Act II</u></b><br><br><i>(Episode returns to the entrance gate of the Spirit Wilds as tourists climb onboard a tram that would take them away. Near the entrance, a small cordon is set up by the police and camera cuts to a close up of Lin addressing her colleagues.)</i><br><br><b>Lin:</b> Get everyone out of here! Put up a perimeter. <i>(one group of policemen leave)</i> Cancel all tours. <i>(Korra and Mako run up to Lin)</i> Somebody get ahold of Tenzin. <i>(the rest of the policemen disperse)</i><br><b>Korra:</b> We got to get in there and find Jinora.<br><b>Lin:</b> I don't think anyone should be going in there right now.<br><b>Korra:</b> I know I'm not the old Avatar I used to be, but I can do this.<br><br><i>(Lin thinks about Korra's request with her hands on her hips before a vine shoots out from the Wilds, past the entrance and snaring itself on the light cable dangling from the entrance. It pulls the lights down before slamming itself against a building. Cut to the trio as Lin looks at Korra, concerned.)</i><br><br><b>Lin:</b> Be careful.<br><br><i>(Location changes to the inside of the now visibly darkened Spirit Wilds. Korra and Mako cautiously tred on the vines on the ground.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Jinora!<br><b>Mako:</b> Hello? Anyone? <br><br><i>(Switch to a frontal shot of the two as a creaking noise is heard off-screen.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(looks to the side)</i> Wait. <i>(Korra looks in the same direction as Mako)</i> Do you hear that?<br><br><i>(Switch to a view inside a building, looking out of the window where the duo are standing as they cautiously stare at the window panes. Return back to the outside as the panes shatter and a vine shoots out to attack the pair. Mako firebends while Korra does a spinning kick, sending a blast of airbending at the vines. A vine grabs Mako by the waist and hauls him back. Korra quickly cuts him free with firebending and he falls to the ground. The Avatar quickly runs off with her friend in tow as the vines continuously reaches out for them.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Come on!<br><br><i>(Cut to the inside of an abandoned building as a hole is earthbent in the wall. Korra quickly runs in while Mako stays at the opening, firing off two attacks at the vines. He slowly retreats backwards as the vines start to come in. Korra quickly earthbends a wall to seal the hole.

You think your power has limits; I say it's limitless.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(cut to a close up of Korra as she glances down dismissively)</i> Whatever. Before, you were always talking about chaos and freedom. Then you took out the Earth Queen and created the worst dictator the Earth Kingdom has ever seen.

Baatar Jr. then brings a pair of binoculars up to his eyes.

Switch to a shot of Kuvira looking angry as she turns to look at the Beifongs hurling rocks at her soldiers. Cut to Lin as she dodges a boulder thrown at her and smashes another with her forearm, then bends up a square stone to block another rock and kicks it forward. She weaves to the side and bends a large boulder up from the ground. Su does a spinning jump kick that sends said boulder flying. She dodges and shields herself with a large stone and throws it forward. <br><br>Some of Kuvira's soldiers are knocked away by the attacks, while one bends up a stone barrier. Cut to Wei and Wing as they work together to fling a massive boulder at the soldiers. They yell and scatter as the rock comes crashing down and shatters into pieces. Su and her sons create a tall rock barrier to shield them and Lin from the soldiers' metal and rock attacks. Cut to a close up of Su as she peeks around the edge of the barrier at Kuvira standing by the cannon. Su frowns and runs off. Cut to Kuvira as she begins to walk down the steps from the cannon. She stops when she suspects something, and turns around in time to see Su vaulting up from the other side of the cannon, kicking a rock down at her. <br><br>Kuvira dodges out of the way, and Su bends the metal from the steps at her. Kuvira deflects the attacks and flings her own metal bands back at Su. Su pulls a plating from the side of the machinery and spins it round, using it as a shield. Su puts her back to the plating and thrusts her elbows back, bending the metal into armor around her back and legs. Su turns and bends a metal plate under her to spring board her over Kuvira. The two throw small metal strips at each other and deflect them in turn, sparks flying as the metal ricochets off the surrounding machinery. <br><br>Su rips part of the railing off and turns it into a makeshift staff, spinning it around to deflect Kuvira's attacks. She drops the rail and then bends a large, heavy cart of supplies at Kuvira from the side. Kuvira blocks it and grunts as she is pushed back, skidding over the floor and creating sparks under her feet. She then lifts the cart over her head and flings it off the cannon and to the ground below. Kuvira dodges in time as Su presses the attack. Kuvira then bends her arm bands into a multisectioned blade on her wrist. Kuvira springboards off a metal plate and lunges at Su. Su cartwheels out of the way of Kuvira's slashing attack, and leans back to avoid the followup aimed at her head. Su then avoids a stab at her face, and turns to grab Kuvira's arm and throw Kuvira over her shoulder and over the rail. Kuvira catches onto the rail, bending her blade into a hook, and swings back around to kick Su. Su groans in pain and rolls over the floor, avoiding two metal strips thown at her. <br><br>Su and Kuvira both get to their feet, and Kuvira bends a cable, catching Su's wrist and throwing her to the floor. Kuvira then bends the floor under Su to bounce her into the side of the machine, before swinging her arms to the side and flinging Su off the cannon and to the ground below. Su rolls on the ground, then looks up to see soldiers surround her. The soldiers are then sent flying upward when Wei lands between them and Su and bends pillars of stone up from under them. Su and Wei hold onto each other as he launches them up on a stone pillar, and we see Lin and Wing behind a circular stone barrier, still fighting other soldiers. Wei shoots a hip mounted cable at them, and Wing throws out his own cable. The two cables wrap around each other, and Wing pulls Su and Wei in and to the safety of their barrier as Lin closes it behind them. <br><br>Cut to a wide overhead shot of them inside the circular barrier as it is pelted by rocks from the soldiers. Cut to Lin and Wing putting their back to the barrier just before they're surprised by a rock breaking through it. The Bei Fongs ready themselves as their barrier starts to crumble, and they face Kuvira's soldiers and mechs. Cut to an overhead shot as Kuvira's forces surround the family. Cut to a close up of Lin as she grits her teeth, nervous but determined. Her expression turns to one of surprise as the ground starts to shake. She looks behind and the soldiers and mechs are knocked over by a wave of earth. Cut to an overhead shot as the earth wave knocks over all the soldiers and mech, but avoids the Bei Fongs. Cut to soldiers being flung against the side of the cannon by the wave, and tilt up to Kuvira looking down from the railing. Change to a close up of Kuvira as she looks up, the camera then cuts to everyone looking behind to see Toph in a bending stance, with Baatar Sr. and Huan behind her, and Opal landing with Bolin and Zhu Li on Juicy behind them.

After Kuvira demonstrated the power of her spirit energy weapon, President Raiko surrendered the city, but the Avatar refused to give up without a fight. Korra held Baatar Jr. hostage, hoping to force Kuvira to back down, but the plan failed, and she fired on Team Avatar's hideout. Can anything or anyone stop Kuvira and her mecha-giant?<br><br><br><br><b><u>Act I</u></b><br><br><i>(Fade in to the smoking rubble of the destroyed Future Industries factory.

A large piece of the building rises and we see Bolin lifting it from below, grunting as his friends and allies run out from under.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(grunting)</i> Go ahead. Take your time. Just bending a giant wall. Man, we got a lot of people here.

Let her take the city for now. We'll think of some way to come back and beat her.<br><b>Mako:</b> What about all the people who haven't been evacuated yet? If Kuvira finds out Wu is with them, she might fire that spirit cannon at him and take them all out.<br><b>Korra:</b> I couldn't stop Kuvira from taking Zaofu. I'm not letting her conquer Republic City. The World isn't safe as long as she has that weapon.<br><b>Lin:</b> I agree. <i>(everyone looks to the side and we cut to Lin standing on top of the rubble)</i> We take down that giant today.<br><b>Korra:</b> Lin!<br><b>Lin:</b> Glad to see you all made it out.

Asami pushes some buttons on the control panel and the hummingbird suit's windows close. Asami flicks a switch and the hum of the suit powering up is heard. The wings unfold and begin to beat rapidly. The suit starts to lift off the floor and hover. It begins to wobble, and mechanical whining sounds are heard.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> I can't stabilize it! I thought you fixed the hydraulics!<br><b>Varrick:</b> I did! Twist harder!<br><br><i>(The suit begins to fly out of control and more mechanical grinding is heard.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> Ah-ah-oh!<br><br><i>(The suit crashes into stacks of cardbord boxes, and Varrick rushes over to it, visibly worried as Asami and Zhu Li exit the suit. Daw then enters the room.)</i><br><br><b>Daw:</b> I hope you have something in here that can take out a platoon of mecha-suits. Kuvira's troops are headed this way!<br><b>Varrick:</b> I know how to take down some mecha-suits, and it just might take down that giant, too! Asami, disconnect anything electrical in here until we get back. Zhu Li, let's go.<br><br><i>(Varrick and Zhu Li exit the room in a hurry. Cut to a shot of Suyin looking down at them through a window from an observation room above. She hears Baatar Jr. stir behind her, and she walks over to him lying down on a cot, sitting in a fold out chair next to him.)</i><br><br><b>Baatar Jr.:</b> Where am I? Mom?<br><b>Su:</b> Just rest, son. I'm here.<br><b>Baatar Jr.:</b> Mom, I'm so sorry. I betrayed you- the whole family. I gave my life to Kuvira, and she just fired that weapon at me. How could she do that?<br><b>Su:</b> I don't know, sweetie. She's a complicated person.<br><b>Baatar Jr.:</b> Wing and Wei will never forgive me. And Opal...<br><b>Su:</b> Yeah, they might take some time to come around, <i>(takes Baatar's hand)</i> but we'll work through it- as a family.<br><br><i>(Baatar Jr. looks up at Suyin. Cut to an overhead shot of the roof of the building. Several large spools of cable are strewn about, the cables connected to a radio tower. The camera tilts up as Varrick climbs it, with Zhu Li behind him carrying a cable spool on her back and letting the cable hang below.)</i> <br><br><b>Zhu Li:</b> Do you think this plan will actually work, Sir?<br><b>Varrick:</b> I know I can stop the mecha-suits with an electromagnetic pulse, so it stands to reason that I can stop a giant mecha-suit with a giant electromagnetic pulse. <i>(Varrick keeps climbing. Cut to a close up of some small cables as Varrick cuts them with cable cutters. Cut to a wide shot of him and Zhu Li on the tower's balcony.)</i> Zhu Li, I've been thinking.<br><b>Zhu Li:</b> You're always thinking, sir.<br><b>Varrick:</b> Yes, but lately, I've been thinking about you. I know we might not make it out of this mess, and I feel like there are some things I should tell you.<br><b>Zhu Li:</b> <i>(smiles, hopeful)</i> There are?<br><b>Varrick:</b> I remember when I was a boy, I had an ostrich-horse. Named her Mrs. Beaks. <i>(Zhu Li's smile drops)</i> I grew up on a farm. Did I ever tell you that, Zhu Li? This was before the circus people took me away. Anyway, I loved old Mrs. Beaks, but I took her for granted.<br><br><i>(The sound of the Colossus' footsteps is heard and Zhu Li looks behind Varrick.)</i><br><br><b>Zhu Li:</b> You'll have to finish your story later. Kuvira's troops are in range. <i>(cut to the wide shot and pan right to show the Colossus walking down the street towards the building. Cut to a close up of a switch held by Zhu Li)</i> Okay. I hope this works.<br><br><i>(Zhu Li turns on the switch. Cut to a low angle shot of Varrick looking up at the top of the tower as it lights up. Varrick ducks and covers his ears as it crackles and makes a high pitched buzz. Cut to an overhead shot of the radio tower as the electromagnetic wave spreads with a thunderclap. Cut to the marching mechas down below as they all topple, gears grinding and metal clanking as they fall.)</i><br><br><b>Varrick:</b> Yes! Dead in their tracks! <i>(the camera tilts up to show the Colossus still walking)</i> Oh, rats. She's still coming. Zhu Li, do the thing!<br><b>Zhu Li:</b> I'm afraid there are no more things to do.<br><br><i>(Cut to the inside of the Colossus control room.)</i><br><br><b>Kuvira:</b> What was that?<br><b>Helmsman:</b> An electromagnetic pulse. It shut down the mecha-suits, but our power source is fine.<br><b>Kuvira:</b> Locate the source of the pulse. That must be where Varrick is. Third and Fourth mech platoons, move in and continue the sweep. Capture anyone left in this city.<br><br><i>(Cut to the estblishing shot of Future Industries Tower, then to the interior where Korra and her allies have gathered. Baatar Jr. sits in a chair in the middle.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Varrick, how come your electro-thingy shut down the small mecha-suits but not the big one?<br><b>Baatar Jr.:</b> Because it's powered with spirit vine energy. I'm sorry. I wish I could help you, but it's unstoppable.<br><b>Hiroshi:</b> It's not.<br><br><i>(Cut to Hiroshi as he enters the room.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> Dad?<br><b>Lin:</b> I got him out of jail to help. I figured we need all the geniuses we can get our hands on right now. If the prison's still standing after all this is over, we can throw him back in.<br><b>Hiroshi:</b> I know what you all must think of me, but I love Republic City, and I would do anything to save her.<br><b>Korra:</b> You think you know how to defeat this thing?<br><b>Hiroshi:</b> You must act like an infection: break the skin and attack the vital organs. Disconnect the heart and the brain and this beast cannot live.<br><b>Korra:</b> But how are we supposed to get inside?<br><b>Hiroshi:</b> Future Industries has plasma says for cutting platinum. If we had one on the mecha-suit...<br><b>Asami:</b> But the saws are way too big. We'd never get the suits off the ground.<br><b>Hiroshi:</b> I think I can add an electrical element to the welding torch on your suit and convert it into a plasma saw. Then we'll just have to land on the giant and cut open a hole big enough for someone to get in.<br><b>Asami:</b> Like a metal mosquito.<br><b>Varrick:</b> You know what happens to mosquitoes that land on me? I squash 'em!<br><b>Korra:</b> We'll have to attack in a swarm to try to keep you guys safe in the hummingbird suits. It looks like they're our only hope.<br><br><i>(Cut to a panning shot of the evacuees sitting in the train station looking bored and irritated as they listen to Pema singing.)</i><br><br><b>Pema:</b> Oh, first he ate the fruit, then he ate the leaves, hungry little lemur ate up all my trees. Okay. Great job, everybody. Who's got another song for us?<br><b>Evacuee:</b> We can't just sit around here singing old airbender songs until we're all captured or worse.<br><b>Pema:</b> Should we play the button game? Who has a button?<br><br><i>(Everyone glares at Pema, then the sound of rumbling alerts them, and we cut to Wu and Tu riding into the train station on badgermoles. The badgermoles stop in front of the evacuees and sniff them.)</i><br><br><b>Pema:</b> Where did these badgermoles come from?<br><b>Wu:</b> The zoo! Mako always hated my singing, but they love it!<br><b>Evacuee:</b> Well, <i>(scoffs)</i> what are we supposed to do with badgermoles?!<br><b>Wu:</b> They're the best earthbenders around! We can use them to tunnel out of the city without Kuvira's troops spotting us!<br><b>Evacuee:</b> Are you sure this is the best plan? <i>(a shot from the Colossus' cannon is seen through the window in the background, and everyone screams at the resulting explosion outside)</i> Let's follow the moles!<br><br><b>Wu:</b> <i>(singing)</i> Badgermoles, digging holes, under Republic City. Got to run away from Kuvira today, although I do still think she's pretty.<br><br><i>(The badgermoles start earthbending a tunnel into the floor and enter it. Cut to a wide establishing shot of the city. There are several very large fires and huge plumes of smoke billowing into the air. Cut to a shot of Kuvira from behind as she metalbends one of the track balls and makes the Colossus'head turn. A helmsman in his chair slides along the outside of the room.)</i><br><br><b>Kuvira:</b> Mech platoons, report.<br><b>Third Platoon Captain:</b> Third platoon. No sign of anyone so far.<br><b>Fourth Platoon Captain:</b> Fourth platoon. En route to train station.<br><br><i>(Cut to the helmsman's point of view as he looks through a periscope and zooms in on Future Industries Tower.)</i><br><br><b>Helmsman:</b> I think we found the source of the electromagnetic pulse: Future Industries Tower.<br><b>Kuvira:</b> That's the place.<br><br><i>(Cut to Asami's workshop as Asami, Hiroshi, Varrick, and Zhu Li work on welding the hummingbird suits, wearing welding masks. Cut to a shot of everyone else waiting nervously as Daw enters the room.)</i><br><br><b>Daw:</b> Kuvira is headed our way.<br><b>Korra:</b> How long will it take to get the plasma saws ready?<br><b>Asami:</b> Just a few more minutes.<br><b>Korra:</b> Get out there as soon as you can.<br><b>Baatar Jr.:</b> If you do manage to get inside, find the engine room. There are two emergency levers. If you switch them off at the same time, you'll cut the power.<br><b>Korra:</b> Thanks. We may not be able to beat that thing, but we can slow it down. Let's go!<br><br><i>(Cut to a wide shot of the Colossus walking through the city. Cut to a closer shot of the Colossus walking around a street corner and zoom out to reveal Korra, Mako, Bolin, Lin, Suyin, Wei, and Wing facing it down and entering their bending stances. Cut to commercial.)</i><br><br><br><br><b><u>Act III</u></b><br><br><i>(Fade in to a shot of Kuvira from the side. Cut to a panning right shot of Korra and her friends readying themselves. Everyone runs forward while Korra airbends a whirlwind beneath her and ascends. Korra hovers on the whirlwind and flies towards the Colossus low to the ground. Korra throws her arms to the side and enters the Avatar State while the Colossus aims its cannon at her and fires. Korra quickly turns around and avoids the attack as the cannon blast destroys the street. Korra goes around a street corner as the cannon fire leaves an explosion in its wake. She lands and earthbends several slabs of the street before using firebending to rocket herself up. <br><br>Korra lands on a rooftop and flings the large slabs at the Colossus. They strike the Colossus in the head and chest and it raises an arm to shield itself. Cut to airbender jumping off a roof and gliding at the Colossus. It swipes its hand at them, distrating it as Korra hits it with another slab. Korra bends more slabs from the rooftop to throw at the Colossus, but it aims at Korra and begins to charge the cannon. Cut to a shot looking up as the airbenders fly in a circle downward, creating a whirlwind which strikes the Colossus' cannon and knocks its arm down. <br><br>The cannon fires at the street below, and the Colossus stumbles back into a building. Cut to Kuvira wincing and then looking out the window. She sees the airbenders flying past and her gaze follows them until she sees Meelo plastering his face against the window, his breath fogging the glass as he gives an unnerving and weird expression. Kuvira is surprised a moment before she takes control of the Colossus and brings its hand up at Meelo, but Meelo jumps out of the way and the Colossus' hand smacks into its face. As Meelo glides away, the Colossus aims its cannon at him and fires. Meelo moves out of the way, but Jinora is in the cannon's line of fire. She looks to see the blast coming at her, but Tenzin catches her and pulls her away.)</i><br><br><b>Tenzin:</b> Jinora!<br><br><i>(Tenzin and Jinora are grazed by the blast and are knocked out of the air. Ikki and Meelo jump from a building and glide after them. Ikki catches Jinora and lands on the side of the building, and she looks down to see Meelo catch Tenzin. Meelo struggles to stop their fall before they hit the ground.)</i><br><br><b>Meelo:</b> <i>(grunting)</i> Whoa! <i>(Meelo thrusts his feet down and shoots a gust of air from them, cushioning their fall before they hit the ground.)</i> Ooh!<br><br><i>(Meelo checks on Tenzin, who opens his eyes just in time to see the Colossus' shadowing them as it steps over them. Cut to Bolin on a rooftop earthbending. He thrusts his fists forward and does a hammer fist to the side. Cut to behind Bolin and we see the skyscraper in front of him being diagonally cut in two, right in the middle, by his earthbending. Bolin, Lin, and Suyin then begin to push the entire top half of the skyscraper over, struggling with all their strength.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Rah!<br><br><i>(Cut to Kuvira as she looks to the side and gasps. The camera pulls back past the window to show it being shadowed. Cut to the top half of the skyscraper falling ontop of the Colossus and pushing it into another building, Kuvira struggling to keep it upright. The buildings collapse around it, and dust and debris obscure the area. Lin and Suyin swing down to the street with Bolin where Korra, Wei, and Wing are as they stare into the dust and wait. Cut to a shot of the Colossus' hand amongst the rubble as all is quiet, until its fingers flex and it begins to rise. Cut to a shot of the Colossus rising out of the rubble, then dissolve into a close up of Kuvira looking dishelved but smirking confidently. Cut to Korra and her allies as they look up, shocked and worried. The scene then cuts to Wu and a badgermole in the tunnel beneath the train station as they continue digging. Wu begins to sing, and it cuts to show the evacuees watching, some covering their ears.)</i>  <br><br><b>Wu:</b> <i>(singing)</i> Oh, Yin. You're the sweetest evacuee I've ever known and I just want to thank you for being so kind when I was living in your home.<br><br><i>(We see Yin smile warmly and placing a hand over her heart, but then the evacuees hear a soldier behind them. It is a sergeant in a mecha suit, along with two other mecha soldiers.)</i><br><br><b>Earth Empire Sergeant:</b> Halt. Turn around slowly, and please, stop that singing. You are all Earth Empire prisoners. Come with us and no one will get hurt.<br><b>Wu:</b> <i>(steps in front of the evacuees and throws his arms to the side)</i> You don't need these people. They're just innocent civilians caught in the crossfire, but I'm Prince Wu, rightful leader of the Earth Kingdom. Take me to Kuvira. I've got business with her.<br><b>Tu:</b> No! Don't do it, Wu!<br><b>Wu:</b> I have to. But before I go, I'd like to sing you a song. <i>(singing)</i> If you don't respect the broach, you don't respect me. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You're no better than a roach but I'm royalty. <i>(as Wu distracts everyone, the badgermoles burrow into opposite tunnels and out of the area)</i> I got my badgermoles with me!<br><b>Earth Empire Sergeant:</b> Actually, your song is so bad, your badgermoles deserted you.<br><b>Wu:</b> <i>(singing)</i> You don't know  what you're talking about. <br><br><i>(The earth starts to rumble, and the soldiers look around worriedly before the badgermoles burrow out from the tunnel walls and smash into the mecha suits under them. Wu smiles when he see the mechas broken under the badermoles and he does a happy twirl.)</i><br><br><b>Wu:</b> <i>(singing)</i> Oh, badgermoles I love ya, I love ya. I want to, I want to pet your snouts. <i>(pets the badermoles snout and then gets on its back)</i> Ha-ha!<br><br><i>(The evacuees cheer with Wu. The scene cuts to a close up of a plasma saw cutting through a platinum plate. Cut to a wider shot to show Hiroshi inside the hummingbird suit as it cuts through the plate, Asami standing beside him. The plasma saw cuts through the plate and half of it falls to the floor, the cut edge glowing hot.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> If we stop that mecha-giant, it will all be because of you.<br><b>Hiroshi:</b> You're the one who designed these incredible suits. <i>(puts his hand on hers and smiles)</i> It's great to be working together again.<br><b>Asami:</b> <i>(smiles back)</i> I love you, Dad.<br><b>Hiroshi:</b> I love you, too.<br><br><i>(Asami and Hiroshi get back to work on the suit as the camera pans left to Zhu Li zipping up her pilot suit as Varrick walks up behind her, hands behind his back.)</i><br><br><b>Varrick:</b> Zhu Li?<br><b>Zhu Li:</b> <i>(turns, her hair whipping in slow motion)</i> Yes?<br><b>Varrick:</b> <i>(gulps)</i> I have something I need to attach before we take off.<br><b>Zhu Li:</b> Attach to what?<br><b>Varrick:</b> <i>(reveals a purple box and opens it to reveal a jade ring)</i> I need to attach this ring to your finger. <i>(kneels in front of Zhu Li)</i> Zhu Li Moon, will you do the thing for the rest of our lives?<br><b>Zhu Li:</b> <i>(pauses a monent, then smiles)</i> Yes.<br><b>Varrick:</b> Yes! <br><br><i>(Cut to a close up of Varrick sliding the ring over Zhu Li's finger. They then kiss passionately.)</i><br><br><b>Varrick:</b> Now, let's go attach these barely-functional rust buckets to a giant killer smashing machine!<br><br><i>(The camera zooms out as Varrick points one finger upward and reveals him holding Zhu Li up with one arm.)</i><br><br><b>Zhu Li:</b> It's exactly how I always pictured our engagement.<br><br><i>(Cut to an overhead shot of the Colossus as it aims its cannon and fires through more buildings. Cut to Wei and Wing swinging from a rooftop and to either side of a building next to the Colossus. They use their earthbending to begin cutting the building in half while they swing around it, but the Colossus fires its cannon at them and knocks them out of the air. Lin and Suyin swing down after them. Lin catches Wei and Wing, and Suyin earthbends two slabs above them as they land to shield them from the falling rubble. Cut to the Colossus swiping at airbenders flying around it, and then zoom out to show Korra in the foreground. Cut to a close shot of Korra as she hears a humming sound and turns to see two hummingbird suits flying towards her, one piloted by Varrick and Zhu Li, and the other by Asami and Hiroshi. Cut to Kuvira as she looks and sees the suits flying towards her and the Colossus. She bends the metal track ball and makes the Colossus aim its cannon at the hummingbird suits. The suits split up and avoid the cannon fire. The one piloted by Varrick and Zhu Li maneuvers around to the Colossus' back.)</i><br> <br><b>Varrick:</b> Aim for that spot in the middle of the back, the one I can never reach.<br><b>Zhu Li:</b> Got it.<br><br><i>(Zhu Li flies the suit towards the Colossus' back and lands on it.

Let's get out of here.<br><br><i>(Zhu Li gets them away in time just as the metal hand slams into the spot they were just on.)</i><br><br><b>Varrick:</b> Wow! I wish I had that kind of flexibility.<br><br><i>(We see Asami and Hiroshi's suit fly around the Colossus and then land in its thigh, Hiroshi controlling the plasma saws as they begin to cut through. The Colossus goes to smack them away, but Asami gets them away in time. Cut to a low, wide shot of the Colossus swiping at the suits, Korra in the foreground. Cut to an overhead shot of Korra watching. She then turns around, and we cut to a tilting up shot of her in the foregound as the camera focuses on a river in the background flowing under bridges in the city. Cut back to Korra's front as she runs for the river. Cut to the hummingbird suits as they continue to fly around the Colossus. It still swipes at them wildly, but cannot hit them. Cut to a wide shot of the Colossus punching the side of a building, and zoom out to show the bridges over the river and Korra running across one. Cut to a high angle shot of the Colossus and we see it walking closer to the river. Cut to Korra as she begins to waterbend and sends a huge wave of water from the river at the Colossus. Korra freezes the water around it, trapping the metal giant as it fires its cannon upward. The cannon fire clips the wing of Varrick and Zhu Li's suit. Cut to the inside, and we see flashing red light and hear a warning buzzer.)</i><br><br><b>Zhu Li:</b> Hang on!<br><br><i>(Cut to a close up of Zhu Li pulling a small cover open and flipping two ejector switches. Cut to outside the suit as we see the back of it pop off, followed by Varrick and Zhu Li being ejected.)</i><br><br><b>Varrick:</b> Ahhh!<br><br><i>(Cut to a low angle shot as we see Varrick's and Zhu Li's parachutes deploy and the hummingbird suit crashes into a building with a large explosion. Cut to a close up of Korra as she waterbends more ice onto the Colossus' cannon arm. Cut to a shot from inside Asami's cockpit looking out through her windshield as she flies the suit towards an exposed part of the Colossus' thigh. She lands it and Hiroshi begins cutting.

Cut to a shot of ice around the Colossus' shoulder breaking and zoom out to show Asami in the cockpit looking at it.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> We need to get out of here.<br><b>Hiroshi:</b> Almost there.<br><br><i>(Asami gasps as a chunk of ice falls on the windshield. She looks up to see more ice breaking away from the Colossus.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> We have to go now!<br><b>Hiroshi:</b> Almost there. Almost there!<br><br><i>(The plasma saws are almost done cutting through. Cut to a close up of the Colossus' shoulder as it finally bursts free from the ice, and zoom out to show the point of view is through Asami's windshield.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> Dad! Now!<br><b>Hiroshi:</b> Good-bye, Asami. I love you.<br><br><i>(Hiroshi flips the ejection switch cover, and then flips the switch to Asami's ejector. The scene goes into slow motion as we cut to a close up of Asami's shocked expression just as she is launched backward and out of the hummingbird suit.)</i><br><br><b>Asami:</b> Dad!<br><br><i>(Cut to a shot from the side of Asami being propelled out of the suit just a mere moment before the Colossus' hand smashes it and Hiroshi. Cut to a shot of Asami floating in her parchute, reaching out with a look of shock, horror, and dismay. Cut to a close up of the Colossus' hand as we see smoke rising from between its fingers. The hand lifts, and the crushed remains of the hummgingbird suit falls to the ground below and reveals the hole Hiroshi sacrificed himself to cut. Cut to Korra, Mako, Bolin, Lin, and Suyin as they look on with sadness.)</i> <br><br><b>Korra:</b> Hiroshi's plan worked. There's our opening.<br><br><i>(Korra and her allies launch themselves up at the Colossus, Korra using airbending, Mako using fire jets, and Lin and Suyin swinging on their cables, Lin carrying Bolin up. They land on the leg and run towards th hole. Cut to Kuvira, who wears an expression of panic and desperation. She metalbends to bring the Colossus' hand down on Korra and her friends. The heroes look up to see the giant metal hand coming down on them, but Korra waterbends a pillar of ice up to stop it. The hand is halted a moment, but breaks through some of the ice. Cut to Kuvira as she thrusts her palm down, and the Colossus pushes through the ice. Korra and her friends make it into the hole just before the hand slams down, and we cut to a wide shot of the Colossus in the ice, the metal slamming of its hand echoing. Cut to a shot of the hand lifting and revealing Korra and her friends safely inside the hole, looking out. Cut to a close up of Korra looking determined.)</i><br><br><br><br>[End Credits]<br>

Is victory within reach for our heroes? <br><br><br><br><b><u>Act I</u></b> <br><br><i>(Fade in to a wide shot of the Colossus covered in ice from the last episode. Cut to a closer shot of its head, then zoom in and dissolve to a zooming in shot of Kuvira in a stance. She stands up straight, then swings her arms to one side. Cut to the Colossus smashing the ice on its other arm, then breaking ice around its waist. Kuvira puts her hand forward, and we dissolve to a matching shot of the Colossus' hand reaching out and grabbing hold of a building. It grips the building's roof, crushing it as the Colossus pulls itself forward and breaks free from the ice. Cut to the Colossus' control room where a red warning light blinks.)</i><br><br><b>Kuvira:</b> Initiate lockdown. Find the Avatar and whoever else is with her.<br><br><i>(Cut to a shot of the hole in the Colossus' thigh as we see a red warning light glow from it. Cut to its inside where Korra and her allies are.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> We need to move fast. Su, Lin, climb up to the arm and try to disable that weapon.

Cut to the heart of the Colossus and tilt down to high angle shot of the large bundle of spirit vines powering it, electricity surging towards two electrodes above it while two guards stand at opposite monitoring stations. Cut to a low angle shot of a hatch on the floor as Bolin cuts through it from below using a lava shuriken like a buzzsaw. He opens the hatch and climbs out with Mako behind him.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> I'm going for that lever.

The guard quickly spots Mako.)</i><br><br><b>Guard:</b> Hey! <br><br><i>(The guard throws metal strips from his uniform at Mako, who ducks to the side and punches blasts of fire at him. The guard ducks the first and metalbends his strips to shield himself from the second, but staggers back.)</i><br><br><b>Guard:</b> Ooh!<br><br><i>(The guard quickly turns and shoots his strips at Mako. A strip knocks Mako's hand away just as he firebends, and the fire hits the spirit vines, causing a violent reaction as electricity surges, a bolt hitting the wall and causing an explosion that knicks Mako into a large pipe. Mako readies himself, then looks behind to see Bolin battling the other guard. Bolin takes cover behind a different pipe as sharp metal strips embed themselves into it. Mako ducks as the guard he battles throws strips at him, and they lodge themselves into the pipe. Mako dodges more attacks as he jumps at the wall, kicks off it, and kicks a blast of fire at the guard, who once again shields himself. Mako presses the attack, kicking an arc of fire, weaving around more strips, and following up with a punch an an uppercut. <br><br>Cut to Lin and Suyin pulling themselves up on the cables and landing on a walkway to a small tunnel. They go in, and we cut to a low angle shot of the other side showing large gears turning. Above we see the two sisters emerge from the tunnel and look down.

Lin and Su avoid more of them, then look down to see a lone guard throwing out more attacks. Lin metalbends a panel from the wall to use as a shield.)</i><br><br><b>Lin:</b> I'll deal with this guy. Disable the weapon!<br><br><i>(Lin throws the shield to the sides and jumps down to the walkway below to engage the guard. She extends blades from the sleeves on her uniform and deflects more attacks as she moves in. Lin shoots her cable at the guard, but he propels himself using the metal floor like a springboard. He bends a metal hatch above Lin to come crashing down on her, but she rolls out of the way. The guard throws the hatch at Lin and she kicks it away. Cut to Lin as she comes to the mechanism which loads spirit vine rounds into the cannon. Su begins to bend, and yanks down the chain of spirit vine canisters down, breaking them off and making them fall against the gear below. Cut to an overhead shot as Su watches the canisters fall into the darkness below. There's a short pause before an explosion of spirit vine energy erupts and races upward. Suyin quickly runs and jumps out of the way back into the tunnel, covering her head. She looks back once the explosion passes, then looks back down and smiles as Lin jumps up next to her after taking care of the guard. Lin looks down, then smiles at Su.)</i><br><br><b>Lin:</b> Nice work.<br><b>Su:</b> The outside may be platinum, but we can do a lot of damage in here.<br><br><i>(Lin and Su quickly get to work demolishing the rest of the cannon arm.

I can feel someone metalbending inside the arm. <br><br><i>(Kuvira begins to metalbend, and the camera pulls out to show the Colossus attempting to swing its rm forward, but it hangs limply.)</i><br><br><b>Kuvira:</b> I lost the connection. The weapon's useless now.<br><br><i>(Kuvira bends again, and then Colossus grabs its cannon arm with the other, then Kuvira bends again and rips the arm off. Cut to Lin and Suyin as they are knocked around inside the arm, and we see it detach from the Colossus' shoulder behind them. Lin bends metal around them both to brace them and keep them from falling out. The Colossus flings its arm and it goes flying before smashing into a building. We see the cannon break off and land within the forest of the city's spirit wilds. Cut to a shot of the dismembered robotic arm and tilt down to the opening where it was attached to the shoulder. Cut to Lin and Suyin unconscious and strapped to the inside as dust falls around them.)</i> <br><br><i>(Cut to Kuvira's back. A clanging sound makes Kuvira turn, and we tilt down to a hatch on the floor below as Korra begins punching through it. The heavy hatch finally breaks off and flies over Kuvira's head just before Korra jumps out on jets of fire and quickly takes out the helmsmen with a double kick that sends blasts of fire at both of them. Korra lands in the middle of the room and punches a fire blast at Kuvira. Kuvira dodges it and another, then bends the large black track balls into a liquid form which she flings at Korra. Korra bends the liquid metal around her like water and then throws it back at Kuvira, solidyfying it and smashing it into Kuvira's side. <br><br>Kuvira grunts as she is knocked away and collides with the control panel. Kuvira quickly gets back up and rushes at Korra, performing a jumping kick that Korra ducks under. Kuvira flings metal strips at her which Korra avoids before Kuvira kicks one of the track ball holders at her. Korra deflects it with airbending and smashes it into the control panel behind her, then follows it up with a fire blast at Kuvira. Kuvira jumps over it, and as she lands she causes the platform they're standing on to tilt off balance. <br><br>Korra yells as it throws her into the air and she hits the ceiling above, creating a large dent in it. Kuvira bends metal around Korra's waist to trap her there and Korra gasps. Kuvira proceeds to drag Korra around the ceiling before slamming her into the control panel, breaking it further. Korra pulls herself up, then ducks as Kuvira throws one of the metal chunks made from the track balls at her. Korra looks up to see Kuvira making three metal chunks float around her. Kuvira frowns, then yells as she throws them at the camera.<br><br>Cut to the engine room where Mako and Bolin exchange blows with the guards. Mako falls on his side and the guard attempts to slam a metal sheet down on him with an axe kick. Mako rolls out of the way and ducks under a second attack. Mako then grabs the nearby railing and kicks both legs out, sending a blast of fire at the guard and knocking him back into the control station. Mako then runs forward and tosses the guard over his shoulder and onto the floor to knock him out, then runs over and grabs the lever next to the control station.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> I'm ready!<br><b>Bolin:</b> Be with you in one second! Kind of busy!<br><br><i>(Bolin hides behind a large pipe, readying his lava shuriken as the guard throws metal strips at him. The guard hides behind the control panel, and Bolin throws his lava shuriken. The glowing hot lava projectile curves through the air and strikes a valve on a pipe on the other side, causing steam to shoot out. The guard quickly gets out of the steam and then looks up as Bolin rushes him and strikes the guard with a shoulder charge. The guard goes flying and hits the pipe behind, knocking him out.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Okay! Ready now!<br><br><i>(Bolin runs to the other lever and grabs it. The screen splits to show both Mako and Bolin at the ready.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> One. Two. Three! <br><br><i>(Mako and Bolin both pull the levers at roughly the same time. Cut to a high angle shot of the spirit vines as they continue to surge with energy.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Nothing's happening.<br><b>Bolin:</b> Kuvira must have done some override thing and taken control!<br><b>Mako:</b> <i>(runs over to Bolin)</i> There's got to be some other way to shut down power from here.<br><br><i>(Bolin looks at the control panel in front of him and nervously hovers his finger over the buttons.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> Um... <br><b>Mako:</b> Come on. You spent all that time working with Varrick and Baatar Jr. Didn't any of their genius rub off on you?<br><b>Bolin:</b> Look, the only thing I know about these vines is that if you mess around with them too much, they explode.<br><br><i>(Mako turns to the spirit vines. Cut to a shot of the vines, tilt up, and the camera focuses on the electricity running from the vines to the nodes above. Cut back to Mako as he comes to a realization.)</i><br><br><b>Mako:</b> Get those engineers out of here. I have an idea. <br><b>Bolin:</b> Want to fill me in?<br><b>Mako:</b> I'm gonna zap these vines with some electricity.<br><b>Bolin:</b> Let's back it up, okay? I said <i>that</i> will make the vines <i>explode</i>.<br><b>Mako:</b> Exactly. This is our only way of shutting this thing down. I can handle it.<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(grabs Mako's shoulder as he turns)</i> No, you can't. This isn't the time to prove how awesome you are. I already know how awesome you are. You're awesome.<br><b>Mako:</b> I don't have time to argue! I'm doing this, so get out of here.<br><b>Bolin:</b> <i>(looks down a brief moment)</i> Okay. But for the record, I do not approve. Just get out as soon as you can. <i>(holds his hand up)</i> Promise?<br><b>Mako:</b> Promise. <br><br><i>(Mako grabs Bolin's hand in his, and they pull themselves together for a hug.)</i><br><br><b>Bolin:</b> I love you.<br><b>Mako:</b> I love you, too. Now go!<br><br><i>(Bolin runs off as Mako faces the spirit vines, and the camera tilts up from him to the electricity. Cut to Mako as he takes his lightning bending stance. Cut to Bolin as he carries the unconscious guards to the hatch. He stops a moment to look at Mako as his brother begins to move his arms and bend lightning. Bolin then goes down the hatch. <br><br>Mako then shoots the lightning at the vines, and the electricity surges, striking the surroundings and creating explosions. Mako holds his stance as the lightning runs through his arms and fingertips. The energy surges up into the nodes hanging above and makes them explode. Mako is knocked back into the wall, but he holds his stance. Mako looks up and sees spirit energy gathering at the ceiling. The spirit vines begin to glow brightly from the inside. Cut to Mako as his sleeve is torn to shreds by the energy and his arm is burned. He winces and grunts, then slowly begins to walk towards the hatch. Before he gets there, a surge of lightning from the vines strikes Mako in the stomach and he falls over, unconscious, his head in the hatch opening. The electricity continues to surge, building up to an explosion. Cut to commercial break.)</i><br><br><br><br><b><u>Act II</u></b><br><br><i>(Fade in to a high angle shot of the Colossus. Through the windows we can see blasts of fire. Cut to Korra as she stumbles back and punches out a blast of fire. She ducks under a liquid metal projectile and then shifts to avoid a metal whip. Korra shoots a gust of wind at Kuvira, then kicks a blast of fire. Kuvira dodges both, and begins to fling more liquid metal at Korra from the three orbs floating around her. She turns two of them into shields to protect herself from more of Korra's fire blasts. Korra then jumps and spins through the air before doing a drop kick that shoots out a large blast of wind. Kuvira tries to shield it, but is knocked away and collides with the window grates, falling to the control panel. Korra ducks under part of the panel Kuvira throws at her as she dashes in. Korra jumps at Kuvira, grabbing her arm and neck and wrapping her legs around Kuvira's chest before twisting and throwing Kuvira to the floor. Kuvira bounces and lands with a thud before Korra bends the floor under her and propels Kuvira up. Korra jumps after her, and the scene goes into slow motion as Korra readies an attack and Kuvira looks at her with shock and distress. Korra hits Kuvira with a blast of air, but at the same time Kuvira throws a metal plate at her. Both of them go flying in opposite directions and slam into the floor and ceiling respectively.<br><br>Cut to a close up Mako unconscious at the engine room hatch, looking up at him as his head and arm hang limply. In the ceiling above we see the spirit energy growing and becoming more violent. The camera zooms out as Bolin climbs the ladder and pulls Mako over his shoulder. Bolin jumps down to the floor below with Mako and runs down the stairs as electricity surges around them, streams of light breaking through the ceiling, and begins to destroy the inside of the Colossus. As Bolin begins to slide down a ladder with Mako, it breaks from the wall due to an explosion. <br><br>Cut back to Korra and Kuvira as they are about to trade blows once more, but they are knocked off balance by the explosion from below, and the light around them turns purple. Cut to a low angle shot of the Colossus as beams of purple light starts to shine from inside its chest, more and more pouring out. A beam hits the camera and almost blinds it with light for a moment, before the entire area suddenly becomes darker. Electricity surges from the Colossus for a second before a purple, circular wave of energy emenates from the Colossus, followed by a huge energy explosion from its center, the top half of the Colossus blown off with a roar of spirit energy. The top of the Colossus hits a building and begins to fall to the ground. Its other arm flies off, and the legs topple and begin to explode. Cut to Korra and Kuvira as they hold on to the railings as debris flies around them. The Colossus' top half slides down the side of the building and lands with a huge crash, the dust clouding the camera's vision.) <br><br>Cut to an overhead shot of the dust clearing around it. Cut to a shot of Mako and Bolin laying unconscious inside the wreckage of the machine. Cut to a shot of the Colossus as its front window is pushes open, knocking aside some rocks. Cut to a shot of Korra pulling Kuvira out of the wreckage, Kuvira's arm over Korra's shoulder. Korra lays Kuvira down on the ground before sighing and sitting on a nearby rock.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> It's over. You're gonna call off your army and surrender to President Raiko. <i>(Kuvira looks at Korra, frowns angrily, and bends a large rock at her)</i> Then you and- uh!<br><br><i>(Korra holds her arms up to shield herself, but is knocked away by the attack. She goes rolling down the hill of debris, groaning in pain as she looks up to see Kuvira limping off into the spirit wilds.)</i> <br><br><b>Korra:</b> Stop!<br><br><i>(Korra gets up to go after her. Cut to Kuvira, her hair undone and messy, panting as she holds her side and leans against a tree. She grunts and stumbles to her knees, but gets up and continues limping through the foliage covered ruins of the city. Cut to a side shot of Kuvira passing behind a tree before stopping to lean against it and catch her breath. She looks behind when she hears Korra.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Kuvira! Give up!<br><b>Kuvira:</b> <i>(quietly)</i> Never.<br><br><i>(Kuvira moves forward. Cut to a shot of Kuvira's front as she pushes away a curtain of vines. She gasps as she looks up and sees what was behind them. Cut to a wide overhead shot of Korra walking down the vine covered, ruined street, passing by the tall trees as rose colored light passes through the canonpy above to a spot on the ground in front of her.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Please, stop this madness! It has to end now!<br><b>Kuvira:</b> <i>(off-screen)</i> If you really want to end it, then come and get me!<br><br><i>(Korra runs in the direction of Kuvira's voice. She passes under a large root and pushes through some bushes, then stops and gasps when she sees what's in front of her. Cut to and quickly zoom out from a low angle shot of the spirit cannon as it hangs from thick vines above and points its barrel straight at Korra. Cut to a close up of Kuvira on the controls of the cannon with her hand on the lever.)</i><br><br><b>Kuvira:</b> Now it's over.<br><b>Korra:</b> <i>(switch to Korra as she raises a hand out in alarm)</i> Don't!<br><br><i>(Return back to Kuvira as she slides the lever down and the camera pans down the length of the weapon until it reaches the end of the barrel which glows purple with spirit vine energy. Cut to Korra as time slows down and she attempts to move away. Switch to a full view of the scene as the cannon fires and Korra manages to jump out of the way in the nick of time. Cut back to a slight close up of Korra as rolls along the ground from the impact and skids to the roots of a nearby tree. Korra looks up and slowly pushes herself off the ground. Switch to a shot from behind Korra as the cannon continues to fire the spirit ray, creating more firey dust.<br><br>Cut to Kuvira's back view as she looks down at the still powered spirit ray. The vines arround the cannon start to glow purple, catching her attention. Cut to a full shot of the cannon as the ray starts to fire with great intensity as more vines supporting the weapon glow purple. The spirit ray creates enough force that it swings the cannon upwards. Cut to an overhead shot of the Spirit Wilds as the ray shoots out from the canopy and slices the top of a building. The ray moves in an arc and destroys more surrounding buildings as well. <br><br>Return back to a full shot of the cannon as its continues to buzz with energy but it sways out of control. Kuvira hangs on to the side as the cannon swings forward. Cut to Korra on the ground.)</i><br><br><b>Korra:</b> Shut it down!<br><br><i>(Switch to Kuvira as she pulls the lever back but nothing happens.)</i><br><br><b>Kuvira:</b> I can't! <i>(the cannon sways violently, causing Kuvira to lose her grip)</i> Ah!<br><br><i>(Kuvira falls to the ground and rolls across the surface, grunting from each toss. Cut to a close up of Kuvira's face as she slowly pushes herself off the ground. She looks at the cannon off-screen and gasps, eyes wide in fear. Switch to the barrel of the cannon as it swings towards Kuvira. Korra suddenly enters the frame and stands in front of the dictator. Cut to a frontal shot of Korra as she brings her arms in close. The camera zooms in on her face and her eyes glow white in the Avatar State as she pushes her hands out. <br><br>Cut to a full shot of Korra bending the energy of the spirit ray, creating a protective dome around herself and Kuvira. The ray hits against the dome but doesn't harm its occupants. Cut to close up back view shots of Kuvira on the ground looking up at Korra. Switch to a close up of Kuvira appearing both fearful and in awe. Camera pans to Korra with her jaw clenched, in the Avatar State as she still holds her hands up to bend the spirit energy. Return back to a far back view shot of the two as the dome suddenly increases in size and expands out, towards the camera. The intensity of the spirit ray turns the screen blindingly white.<br><br>Cut to an aerial view of Republic City as a purple explosion occurs with a roaring boom, spreading shockwaves out. The purple dome is now a gargantuan size with three concentric white rings of varying sizes floating above it. The shockwaves dissipate but the dome continues to grow. The rings above the dome disappear and the purple hue glows into an intense white glare. <br><br>Switch to a shot of the shell of the Colossus on the ground as the dome expands towards it, engulfing it with debris. Cut to the Air Kids on the street with Jinora supporting Tenzin's weight. Seeing the purple dome head towards them, they quickly run off-screen for cover. Cut to the family entering the lobby of an apartment building and they huddle in the corner near the mail boxes. Tenzin quickly hugs his children close to him and they all bend down with their heads bowed protectively. Smoke rushes past the street outside and fills the entire lobby, shrouding them entirely. <br><br>Cut to Asami running out of from an alley onto the street as the purple glow heads towards her. She stops in her tracks and is surprised by what she's seeing. Switch to the stairs of an underground entrance looking out to the street as Asami quickly ducks into it, bending down with her hands around her head. She closes her eyes tight and the smoke covers the whole street and enters the tunnel, enveloping the inventor.<br><br>Return back to an overhead shot of Republic City as the dome expands out a little more until it stops. Cut to an alley looking out at the main street as the smog continues to rush forward before stopping. Suddenly, all the smog is rapidly pulled back to its source. Cut to an overhead shot of the dome as it shrinks, collecting all the smoke with it. The purple glow is gone and we see a golden ball of light in the middle of the Spirit Wilds. A split second later, a golden light shoots out to the sky, creating a third Spirit Portal in the heart of Republic City. A helix of orange and green rays entwine around each other within the golden light.<br><br>Camera cuts to Kuvira's troops looking at the portal beam making its way to the heavens. Return back to a shot of the spirit portal as the camera follows the golden ray up to the clouds which are bathed in a golden glow. Heartwarming, spiritual music plays. Cut back to the portal on the ground, now situated in the middle of a gaping vine crater of what was once the lush Spirits Wilds. The orange and green rays continously rotate around each other within the golden light. Broken remains of the spirit ray cannon can be seen laying in the crater.<br><br>Cut to an escape hatch of the remnant of the Colossus opening to reveal Bolin supporting Mako who has a nasty burn on his left arm.
